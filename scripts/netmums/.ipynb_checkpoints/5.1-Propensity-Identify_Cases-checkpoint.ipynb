We went through a re assessment of his statement, it was agreed for other LA's to see if they could meet his needs and all 5 neighborouing authorities couldn't for one reason or another, after meeting him I may add. I also spoke to a few independant schools to see what they had to offer. Got back to the authority with a few ideas of how to progress, told them it would be much cheaper to offer a service at home rather than going to tribunal and me winning, hence the strong position I'm in. So hopefully soon he will be educated at home 3 full days per week.\n",

      "Hi I'm 38 and 18 weeks pregnant with baby no 4. I had my first 2 who are now 11 & 12 much younger and thought I was done, especially as I had DS & DD. Then I got divorced 8 years ago and met my husband now 3 yrs ago. He is also great with my kids but I always knew he wanted some of his own. So in Jan this year I gave my birth to another little boy :) As I didn't want him to feel like an only child (older 2 will be teenagers and off doing their own thing in a few years) we decided on baby no 4! Due in April and there will be 15 mths between them. I was worried about age, and starting again etc etc. But now I have him it's all perfect. Hes gorgeous, the kids adore him and are a great help, and I feel much more relaxed this time round. Also, as the older 2 are growing up, its lovely to have a baby in the house again. The positives far outweigh any negatives. Good luck, hope all goes well and here's to a BFP and a lovely bundle of joy at the end of it!\n",

I dont think u should just try for a particular sex but if you would be just as happy with a girl again if you didn't get a son go for it. My 2 youngest are very close especially since the oldest two only live with me half a week, the 4yr old was quite lonely when they went back to their dads and she was on her own with us but now she has her brother all the time\n",

There is such a horrible stigma attached to you trying for a baby over 40. It's sort of become accepted if you're still in your 30's but it's that dreaded four 0 that has everyone reeling with shock. But I am so broody, for the first time in my life. I was married for ten years to a bloke who never wanted kids and I accepted that. We are now divorced and I'm engaged to a great bloke who, although has two grown up children from his first marriage, has no qualms at becoming a dad again in his mid 40's. We've been trying like mad and I'm now into my 2ww, how frustrating... arghhhh, I just want to do the preg test - lol...

So what are the rules on folic acid? If I start taking it again now will it be the same as starting from scratch and taking it for 3 full months before trying to conceive or if I start taking it again now will the past few weeks still count?!

Yesterday I started to bleed very very very lightly more like spoting and I thought my period had come a bit early as I am a little iregular. I normaly would be bleeding very heavely by now but still only have less then yesterday- hardly any. This morning on my way out to work I just felt really nauseas and had to run home to throw up but then afterwards I felt fine and have felt only a little bit nausea after eating the rest of the day. Out of pure frustration of not understanding what the hell my body was doing I took a preg test this eve and there was a v v v faint second line. I know you guys cant say for sure but do I sound Preg and should I test gain and is it ok that I have bleed a bit and what if I bleed more? Thanks all Han\n",

I use the period tracker app on my iPhone and it has worked out I have an average 25 day cycle, if I go by this I am 4 days late for AF. If I go on a 28 day cycle I was due AF yesterday...I have had symptoms nearly 2 weeks now, all of which I haven't had any other month, but have still had BFN's on tests I have done (including one tonight) Anyway, hopefully my body will work out what it wants to do soon, I want to stay in the loop on here as I think it's a very positive support group and wish everyone luck and baby dust :)\n",

      "Hi everyone :) I've been lurking here for months seeing all the amazing support you give each other and now I'm starting my ttc journey I have finally joined properly. I'm 30 and got married last year, DH and I have been together since I was 19. We never really talked about kids because neither of us like them much, but a couple of years ago I discovered that despite that, biology still takes over and provides that fierce desire to reproduce that can't be surpressed. Poor DH was a bit shocked. I've been on the pill for 12 years and when I got my last 6 months from the doc I told DH that it would be the last lot, and he had six months to get his head around it. Sounds a bit brutal but I couldn't wait for him to be competely up for it or it would never happen. He is slowly coming around to the idea though, which is a relief. So I took my last pill just over a week ago, had my withdrawal bleed and today we had our first ever unprotected sex. For now my excitement about ttc has to be kept quiet so as not to freak DH out, so I take my pregnacare on the quiet and probably any testing will be done in secret, for now at least. Anyone else in a similar position? Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself as I will probably be around a lot over the coming months. F x\n",

I had so many symptoms..and I wasn't even symptom spotting :/ I had back ache, really bad bloating, tender boobs and a god awful mood on me..but I wasn't pregnant. Funny how I've never had any of these symptoms before and all of a sudden when ttc I do! Anyway because my periods are all over the shop I decided to buy ovulation test. I tested positive on the 23rd (afternoon ) and felt the cramping in the evening. We were down to business on the 21st late that night. So almost 2 days before the positive test. It's now 8dpo. I've had cramping since I ovulated which is something new to me.had shooting pains down there one day but it's been pretty much pressure pain. My back is hurting today and my boobs were killing me yesterday. I also woke up with a cold sore which I haven't had since I was about 6..obviously this is a sign my immune system is low. Also I've had the strangest dreams :/ very odd. I don't usually dream anyway but if I do I never remember them. These are almost real like. Anyway I'll stop waffling on..sorry Any thoughts or anyone who has had symptoms similar would be good to hear from. Thanks :)\n",

I went out shortly after taking the test and when i returned 5 hours later there was a thick pink line. So using the same urine I tested again. To start with it was negative and then I went out to buy more tests. Again well after the 10 minute time limit there was another thick pink line! The CB digital said not pregnant and the FR test didn't show a line. I know after the time limit I should disregard the result but if that had appeared within the time frame I'd be convinced I was pregnant. I've retested today with second urine using a cheap midstream test from B&M and I am certain there is a very faint second line within the time frame. As soon as I finished peeing I could see the line! But it's super faint! I don't know how to post pics from my phone as there isn't an attachment option otherwise I'd have shown you the Internet cheap tests.

Not only do I have PCO but DH has abnormalities with his sperm count (appointment tomorrow to find out what) Last month my cycle lasted 30 days. I had just started taking prenatal vits a friend recommended & thought they may have contributed but I am currently on CD36 & no period however my boobs have been agony for the last week or so. That & tiredness are my only symptom. I am as sure as I can be I ovulated back around CD16! I have taken multiple tests over the last week & all negative. I don't temp any more but will take it tomorrow to see if that indicates anything? I was wondering has anyone out there been in a similar position with negative tests and maybe gone on to have a BFP? I have had period pains however only lasted 10 mins & so mild. Not particularly irritable as I would be leading to AF.

      "Hi netmums I am so confused at the moment I feel like my brain will explode!! I'm hoping that writing it down plus your advise might help. Here goes... Ds1 born 1997 - emergency section, 4 days overdue, foetal distress Dd1 born 1998 - section, 10 wks early, IUGR Ds2 born 2009 - section booked for 39 wks but went into labour 38+5, quick labour (3 hrs) so no time for section, born by ventouse. I was so thrilled as I hadn't liked the idea of an elective section and it was all so exciting and unexpected!! Fast forward to now. I am pregnant again and worked hard to convince my consultants to let me try for another VBAC. Eventually they agreed. They warned it would probably be early and quick again and I would need constant monitoring. If I did go overdue they would let me go to 41 wks but couldn't induce me so section it would be. I was happy with that as I was sure it would be early. Got to 36 wks and suffered from SPD. Painful and very uncomfortable. After 2 wks in agony my consultant said the option for section was still there and eventually I agreed to book it for 40+1 wks. I was still so sure it would come before but felt better mentally with a back up plan! I am now 39+5 days and nothing!! Not a twinge or anything. Just pain from spd. The section is fast approaching and I'm getting cold feet. I don't know whether to wait til 41 wks now having come this far and hope baby comes by then, or just have the section next week. What if I wait til 41 wks and still have section. I'll have suffered an extra week for no reason. What to do???!!! Being my 4th child I was so sure it would be early. Never for a minute did I consider I would get to 40 wks or over ESP given what happened only last year. Just need some feedback...\n",

I have to sit in room until he folks asleep. He doesn't need me to hold him or anything, just sit there. If I try to leave as he is drifting off he starts to sit up and start screaming again. He doesn't wake in the night, but is up at 5.30-6am and screams til I get him at 7am. Same with daytime naps. I have no idea what's happened. Nothing has changed at all.

      "Hi Apologies in advance for the long post but I'm going to try and add all details of my concerns. I first started worrying about DS when he was 12 mths. I noticed he wasn't responding to his name and then realised his eye contact was a bit amiss (been fine to that point). He also wasn't clapping or waving at this point. Spoke to HV who referred him for hearing test which came back clear. HV recommended spending some 1:1 time with him (he's the youngest of 4!) and shed review at 18 mths. At 18 mths he'd only just started clapping and waving but no pointing. Eye contact was still hit and miss, responded to name say 60% of time and had no spoken words although babbled incessently. I also became concerned that he didn't seem to understand much of what I said. Pushed for SALT referral and development assessment from community paed as I started to worry about ASD. Got appt for both at 21 mths. Paed signed him off saying his development was on target or above for all areas except speech and language. SALT saw him and agreed to put him on their list for sing and sign therapy at 23 mths which he is now so waiting for appt date. He will be 2 on 13th April and still says no words apart from 'addy' when his dad comes in from work. Basic understanding of routines such as bedtime, bathtime, dinner time but if I said 'where's mummy or daddy' then nothing! He happily plays with all toys, no strange behaviour, some imaginative play, cognitive play is good. Germ my attention by pulling my arm, taking my hand etc. Still doesn't point, and doesn't look where I'm pointing either. I'm still worried about ASD and keep being told that although he's far too young diagnose now anyway, they are not concerned with that being the issue. They believe its a receptive language delay which is having a knock on effect on expressive language, as well as the non verbal cues - pointing etc. We are also now seeing a private speech therapist (2 sessions in) whilst waiting for NHS appointment. I guess what I'd like to know is if anyone was in a similar situation and it did resolve or did you go on to have a ASD diagnosis. Or anyone in a similar situation now and his they're coping.

He is severely S&L délayed. His understanding is very delayed, he only seems to understand one/two word sentences and instructions. He has a few words and phrases he can say but most are just repeated parrot fashion. It's been assessed as being around 15-18 mths stage. He is also being assessed for ASD due to showing some traits like lack of eye contact, delayed imaginative play. They aren't sure if its an SLI or ASD. My question is have any of you parents had children who had limited speech and understanding as toddlers and did it improve as they got older. I can't ever imagine him understanding what I say and fear he'll always be like a baby with his S&L whilst everything else develops normally :-(\n",

      "Hi everyone My little boy is nearly 3 and is currently being assessed for autism. The main signs are his significant speech and language delay, lack of eye contact, limited imaginative play. His understanding of language is very delayed - assessed at around 15-18 mth level. His speech is very delayed too. He has lots of words/phrases he can say but they are mostly copied and not really used appropriately in conversation. So, for example, he can name lots of animals and make their sounds but won't talk about them. He doesn't really ask for anything if he needs it but rather pulls me by the hand. He can name many objects but no connectives or verbs. So you can't have a conversation with him at all. My question is - when people describe their ASD children as non verbal what exactly do you mean? Can they say nothing at all? Or are they like my DS in that they can't have a conversation? Thanks for reading x\n",

      "Hi My son aged 3 has s&l delay and is being assessed for ASD. From 11 weeks until 3 weeks ago he has always slept like an angel. I could put him down at 7pm and he would settle himself. He would then wake around 6am and quietly chat/play in his cot until 7am when I went to get him. 3 weeks ago he woke up at 1am screaming and I went to him. He wouldn't settle so I ended up lying on his floor and holding his hand through the cot bars until he fell asleep about an hour later. I thought it was a fluke and thought no more of it. The next night it happened again and this time he didn't re-settle for 3 hrs during which time if I tried to leave his room he would scream blue murder! It's then continued since. He started climbing out of his cot and running around crying in the middle of the night so I moved him into toddler bed and put a gate on his door. Now I have to sit in his room when I take him up at 7pm until he falls asleep. Then he can wake anything between 2-4 times a night. Each time he gets out of bed, opens his door, stands by his gate and cries until I go back in. He'll then settle back fairly quickly. He doesn't want a cuddle or pat on back or anything - he just needs me in the room. I have now moved a mattress down there and some nights if I'm really tired from the constant waking I'll just sleep in there in the corner. On those nights he doesn't wake again! Any ideas on what could have caused these or any tips on how to solve this?? Thanks\n",

      "Hi, I could really do with some advice. Me and my hubby have been trying (ish) for about 4 months now and over the last couple of days my body has been being v v odd and I am wondering if I could be preg. Yesterday I started to bleed very very very lightly more like spoting and I thought my period had come a bit early as I am a little iregular. I normaly would be bleeding very heavely by now but still only have less then yesterday- hardly any. This morning on my way out to work I just felt really nauseas and had to run home to throw up but then afterwards I felt fine and have felt only a little bit nausea after eating the rest of the day. Out of pure frustration of not understanding what the hell my body was doing I took a preg test this eve and there was a v v v faint second line. I know you guys cant say for sure but do I sound Preg and should I test gain and is it ok that I have bleed a bit and what if I bleed more? Thanks all Han\n",

However there are some areas that I could really do with some advice on. 1) Would I get isolated, at the moment I work in a close team and I am worreied if I became a childminder I would lose the benefits of working with others.. 2)How do/did you build up your client base? I was hoping to use NCT, facebook etc to advertise. 3) Do I have to be able to drive? I cant drive atm and even if I learnt I would not have access to a car, however that said I am in a town with good bus links and nice country parks etc near by 4) How much does it cost to set up? Would people be worried that I have a dog? 5) What about holidays, What about when i get preg with my second? Sorry lots of questions, I am just trying to work out if this is really the route I want to go down. The main things that attracts this career to me is that I will be able to look after my LO at home alongside looking after other children, this will give LO benfeit of daycare, such as playing with other children but also means I dont have to leave him to go to work.

Anyway I have written up some pros and cons...... Pros of working (part time) · Money · Adult company · Will have something to go back into once child is in school. · Will not damage career so much Pros of being a SAHM · No child care costs · Being mum to child and spending crucial first years with child · Child not being looked after by someone else · Have chance to take child to activities that could help in there development · No stress of work · Having the opportunity to volunteer and possibly find new career ideas. · Shorter hours for child...can install routine · Chance to keep house clean · Chance to meet other parents. What I really want to do Cons of working Work is already slowly breaking me....so stressull · Child care costs- will it out way benefit of working · Not spending time with my child · Having child looked after by someone else · Long hours for child · Not really enjoying work · Not putting in 100% into work as want to be with child · Could miss child’s developmental milestones. · Being so tired from work that I can’t look after child in eve Cons of being a SAHM · Possible less adult company in less I put myself out there · Could be harder to find work when I want to go back · Could get board · Not getting paid · Could damage my career – may have to retrain. (would that nessarly be a bad thing?) I really dont know what to do? I am not really expecting people to make the decsion for me but just to give me your views on both being a working mum and a stay at home mum.....OH says i need to bring in £400 a month....I could do this just by cleaning some friends houses...I just dont know Please dont turn this into a massive fight between SAHM and working mums, the pros and cons relate to me its not the same pros and cons for everyone else.

Just a bit of background...I have been REALLY sick with this pregnancy....signed off work....fainting....not being able to get out of bed....sick multiple times a day, could not eat or drink (Hypermesis Gravidarum). My OH looked after me those 4 months...he had to do pretty much everything for me....and I had to be totaly relaint on him....this was not easy on either of us....however he knew that I would do the same for him if I was in this situation. Before I fell preg I organised a trip to Wales with some friends and we were in the process of moving house. superisinly enough when it came to moving house the house was not clean....OH was working full time...looking after me and I was near enough bed bound....so cleaning did not get done. \"Friend\" said that house was dirty and that I should not have baby if I could not keep the house clean and that morning sickness was all mind over matter....even tho she knew full well it was more then that. She also said I should not be takeing the meds the doc gave me as I was damerging my baby. However what upset me the most and what I am unsure if I can fogive this is that she said I was treating my OH like **** because I was not looking after him and helping him. She said that when we went to Wales he looked so tired and fed up....At wales I was there spent most of it in bed/sofa..only went as OH wanted to climb mountin and we organsised it so would cause so much trouble if we canceled. OH was tired and fed up at the time....he was looking after me when I was ill, pucking and unsure if baby would be ok....he was having to do more of his fair share of work...Jon said I was not treating him like **** and that he knew if the postion was swaped I would do the same for him. I basicly told her to **** off. I was so cross that she said I was harming my baby by takeing meds, I was so cross that she I was basicly being lazy when I was so very ill and I was so cross that she said I was treating my OH like **** when I was letting him look after me (not that I had any choice) Anyway today I woke up and she texted me saying she was sorry, she said that she did not mean to hurt my feelings and that she was just thinking I should do something for my OH once in a while as when he was at wales he looked so fed up and tired. I dont really know what to say to her. Half of me thinks I dont want her around me...she is so judgemental and that when baby is born house is not gonna be very clean for a bit and I will be very tired and if I have a C section she is not gonna be a good infulence around me. The other half of me thinks that this is a petty thing to fall out over and that I should fogive her...she clearly does not understand how ill I was but thats not her fault and she is not a mum and has never been preg. I feel like asking her if she was so worried about my OH why on earth did she not call him and talk to him? We both could have done with that support! I am now at the point were I am a little bit better now having normal moning sickness at 24 weeks!....I am back at work JUST, I can do a bit of cleaning and can get out of bed and I am starting to do more for Jon and for me. Would you fogive this? Do you think she was just being navie and stupied?\n",

      "Hey all, does my birth plan look to long? is there anything in there that is unrelastic/going to **** off M/W? its my first child so dont really know what to expect. B]Birth Preferences for our baby[/B] The safety of me and my baby are the most important thing My husband and my doula will be present, I do not want to be left alone without husband or Doula under any circumstances. I would ideally like to give labour and give birth at home. I would like to use the birthing pool, labouring and giving birth in the pool. Please do not offer me pain relief. I know what is available and will ask for it if I need it. I would like as much privacy as possible. If my eyes are closed/blindfold on, please do not interrupt me. I would like the lights to be dimmed – bright lights can give me migraines Please remind me to go to the loo to empty my bladder every hour. I would like to remain as active as possible, finding the best positions for me and changing these as I wish. I would like to try to rest between contractions where possible. I would like monitoring of baby to be kept to a minimum and I do not want vaginal examinations unless there is cause for concern. Please use a hand-held sonic aid and not continual monitoring. If you do have to examine me please do not tell me how dilated I am. I would prefer no interventions (e.g. breaking waters) unless a medical emergency precipitates them. I would like information about any proposed medication before receiving it: the purpose, potential side effects on me/the baby and options on timing e.g. before or after the baby is born. I would like to use hypnosis/TENS/water/massage/gas and air during my labour. I do not want anyone to offer me any pain relief. I would like to find an upright, comfortable position for pushing. Advice will be welcome. I do not want to push lying on my back unless medical vital. I wish to know when the head is crowning. I would appreciate firm advice and guidance at this time to guard against tearing. I do not wish to have an episiotomy unless medically vital or I agree to it. I would like to pick up the baby and I would like skin to skin contact and to put our baby to my breast as soon as possible, ideally to find the breast itself. I would like any help in positioning the baby for breast feeding you can offer. I wish the cord to remain attached until it stops pulsating. My husband would not like to cut the cord. I don't mind who does If I have had a natural birth, I would to try a physiological third stage. If a tear occurs I want to be advised whether or not I need to be stitched and I will then choose whether or not I need a local anaesthetic. I wish to be stitched by an experienced midwife or doctor. I do not mind one student observing/assisting with my birth so long as they are supervised. Needing to be transferred I would like either my husband or doula to come with me in the ambulance to offer me reassurance Please try and keep everything calm and offer me lots of reassurance Please be honest with me about the reasons I need to be transferred I only want to be transferred if me or my baby is in danger. Emergencies My husband and I will discuss all eventualities as they arise. Please share any concerns with us as soon as they arise and be honest with us about the risks involved. Before we make a decision we It will help us to know the answers to these questions: 1. Is baby or me in danger? 2. What is wrong? 3.What do you suggest and why? 4. What would be the best possible outcomes with and without this intervention? 5. How much time do we have to make a decision? 6. Are there any other courses of action open to us? Caesarean I would like my husband to be present If possible I would like baby first voice it hears to be mine I would like baby to be placed onto me, if this is not possible I would like me husband to have skin to skin contact. If baby and me are separated I would like my husband to stay with baby and gill to be with me to support me, I DO NOT want to be left alone without husband or my Doula. I have seen C-Sections performed and am pretty scared of them. Please try and keep theatre as calm as possible and offer me lots of reassurance. Ventouse/forceps I really do not want forceps if the situation arises please try and use Ventouse first. Please keep the environment as calm as possible and offer me lots of reassurance\n",

      "Hi all just looking for advice so the back story is I have two ds 9 and 5 so my ds9 stayed at my mums Sunday night there he had a play gun which has string in it and u have to to pull it and it pops anyway he came home Monday morning with a circle on his face and other bruises around it I was shocked and ask my mum and she said he was on his iPad whilst pulling the gun by his face. I was horrified he went to school with my mum and she explained and took the gun to show the teacher everything was fine. I then took him to school on Tuesday and I also took the gun to the receptionists as the teacher the day before was supply. As he went in the deputy head was there and said I heard about this so o showed her the gun and she explained to my son on what has happened to the blood vessels anyway today my ds5 is autistic and wasn't feeling very well so he wasn't in school I rang the school to ask if they can tell my ds9 if he could run home and I would be waiting by the wall by our houses which I can see his classroom door from there and my back door is about 15 steps away.anyway my ds dad came home from work and just popped in to see my ds as he was ill and I said will u wait there while I go to the wall and wait for my other son and that was fine I see the classroom door open and I see my son there and I'm waving to him and I can see him pointing to me and he was just waiting there so at about 3.28 I started walking towards the gates and my son was running threw crying I said what's wrong and a teacher from the school told him he wasn't allowed to leave to which I said I rang and told them I will be waiting. Hd said I told them mum that my mums there I can see her and my little brother is most probably at the house so I need to go quickly.. Him not knowing his dad was at the house. I went to the school receptions and ask her if she had said I rang and told him to run home and she said she passed the message on I was very angry as my son was upset and told her they wouldn't let him go. My concern is that my son has said I should go quickly as my brother is in the house meaning he's on his own which is not true in just really scared they might phone social services\n",

I got passports for him I was told I don’t need his fathers permission as long as I take his full birth certificate with me which is fine... he comes the confusing part.. I was born in South Africa and left at about 6months old to live her so I have a South Africa birth certificate on my birth certificate my middle name is reeanna but I was always told my middle name was Rhiannon.. my father registered me [emoji15] so I had a passport as a child and my name was Rhiannon on that, my driving license is Rhiannon and on my sons birth certificate it’s Rhiannon!! So I applied for my first adult passport and I was told my middle name has to be the same as what’s on my birth certificate or I have to de poll my name so I just said no it’s fine I just wanted my passport.. anyway I’m in complete panic mode as if I get stop either going to Disney or out of Disney going by euro star and they ask me for my sons birth certificate and my middle names is not the same as on my passport will they stop us!!! I don’t know if I’m completely overthinking it or should I really be concerned [emoji46] thanks everyone in advance xxxx Sent from my iPhone using ::link_1::\n",

I see we will have to go for an interview yet he works for 35hrs a week I’m concerned they will question us about having a child that’s aged 9 together and now we have decided that we will live together.. or question me about him?

I thought the interview went great and at the end asked me for enhanced dbs which I agreed to so I was telling my mum and she said did you tell them about the time I went to court I said no... I actually completely forgot that I was did have to go to court about 10/11 years ago for assault I generally for I have been through so much since then and I’m a completely different place in my life and would never in life do this ever again anyway I know this will come up on my dbs but I didn’t tell them [emoji52] I’m now no I won’t get the job [emoji22] which I’m actually heartbroken over but I’m thinking maybe I should ring them and tell them I completely forgot or should I just forget about it any advice would be grateful xx Sent from my iPhone using ::link_1::\n",

Any way my youngest has special needs and autism im on benifits as a single mum and he lives with his parents. He comes over most nights after work to spend time with the children (I don’t let them go to his mums as she smokes and has a bad mould issues at her flat and a big dog which my son is petrified off) anyway he’s a big help to me and when my son doesn’t sleep he will come over and let me sleep and stay up with him.. he works 35+ hrs a week.. we spoke about moving in together recently and just see how it goes.. as far as I’m aware he has no bills at his mums just a credit card and his letters like bank statement but he’s not on the council tax.. anyway I’m wondering if we do move in who do I inform and will this make me go to universal credit any advice would be much appreciate Thank you Sent from my iPhone using ::link_1::\n",

      "My son and I recently wrote a book called, “That’s Cool!” (available on Amazon). One of our goals is to help kids with ADHD by directing their energies in learning life skills while raising their confidence, and building self-esteem. We believe that school-aged children will find the tricks in the book fun and give them a feeling of accomplishment. Joining your child in learning the tricks and skills in the book offers another opportunity to connect and develop an even closer relationship.\n",

      "Hi - I'm new here. I'll try not to ramble! About 18 months ago I read an article on Inattentive ADHD that fit my daughter so perfectly I could have cried. We're on the way to a diagnosis, which is being held up by lockdowns, Covid restrictions and school closures. We were referred to a New Forest Parenting Course, which was downgraded to a webinar due to Covid. It was useful, but obviously focused on how I could change my behaviour, rather than on coping strategies for my daughter. In addition, all the other parents seemed to have boys who had hyperactive/impulsivity problems - desperately in need of help, but very different. She's funny, bright, curious about the world, super-creative, thoughtful and enthusiastic about so many things, but she's losing track of her positives underneath the negatives. So much is a huge struggle for her. I'm trying, but I'm failing her massively - and the guilt of not spotting this earlier is really getting me down. Does anyone know of any groups, forums, Facebook groups etc where it's possible to find further help? I'm really struggling to find what she needs. Many thanks for reading, W\n",

      "Hey Jacqui, Hang in there, I bet you are doing a great job. I am in the same boat with my 9 years old who is in the process of getting diagnosed. And good for you getting this diagnosed at this time. I also subscribe to AHA parenting emails and have listened (more than once) to the audio book \"Calm parent Happy Child\" and these have helped immensely. Loads of information is on the AHAparenting website and its very easy to navigate too so if you don't have time to read the book it's all there (from what I can see) and its free too. I would join a good support group too (online or otherwise). This quote from Gorden B. Hincley helps me too and I've started reading it to him and my other children also: Believe in yourself. Believe in your capacity to do great and good things. Believe that no mountain is so high that you cannot climb it. Believe that no storm is so great that you cannot weather it. … You are a child of God, of infinite capacity.::link_1:: Stand a little taller, rise a little higher, be a little better. Make the extra effort. You will be happier. You will know a new satisfaction, a new gladness in your heart.::link_2:: Of course there will be some problems along the way. There will be difficulties to overcome. But they will not last forever. [God] will not forsake you. … Look to the positive. Know that He is watching over you, that He hears your prayers and will answer them, that He loves you and will make that love manifest.::link_3:: This quote is from here: (although it appears garbled) ::link_4:: We can do this! All the best, C (Katey is close to but not my real name :-)\n",

      "Hey guys,so basically im currently trying to get my son assessed for adhd and asd,ive got the dla forms here,i ordered them weeks ago. The school senco rang me and said that my sons teacher has said he's fine in school with no concerns. This really annoyed me as deep down i know theres something,ive had suspicions for 3 years and family/friends have mentioned it too. I just feel like the school are not really interested at all in trying to help. The only thing is on the dla forms theres a question that asks for a professional to fill it in. Obviously i know what my sons teacher is going to answer,so i was wondering has anyone sent the form off before without filling in the professional bit? Or did you get someone else to fill it in other than the teacher x\n",

      "Hey! Good evening! I have known my step daughter since she was 2 years old (Now 11) and I really feel that she presents many traits of a child with ASD. Since being little everyone has always commented on how quiet/shy she is and honestly I never really thought anything more of it until the last few years. She started high school in September 20 and since then it seems to have become really obvious and I feel like I've let her down in not noticing the signs sooner. She hasn't made any new friends since starting high school, not a single one. She has always struggled to make friends and the friends she has made she has always struggled to keep. Its like its a chore for her to have friends. We go on holiday every year (besides 2020 obvs) and she's never once made friends with any of the other children in the pool etc and just sits entirely by herself reading. She's obsessive with reading and gets through a few book a week, im talking books that would take me a few weeks to get through she reads in a day or two. She also struggles massively with social cues. For example, saying hello and goodbye to people even when they say it first. She has never once said happy birthday to anyone, including her Dad and her siblings, or merry Christmas etc. Its like she genuinely doesn't get those cues. She's exactly the same with saying sorry, unless she's told to apologise for something it wouldn't even cross her mind. Alongside this she very rarely smiles, even when I'm sure inside shes excited or enjoying something, she shows no emotion at all. She never smiles back at people and very, very rarely initiates a conversation. If anyone starts a conversation with her she rarely answers verbally, she will just shrug her shoulders or nod her head instead. On the rare occasion she does respond verbally, its yes or no and very rarely anything more. She is more than capable at responding verbally, her speech was absolutely amazing from when I met her a two years old, she just chooses not to. The next thing I've noticed and has been an issue for many years is clothing and shoes. Getting her into a bridesmaid dress for our wedding was her worst nightmare. She lives in joggers and a hoody with no seams, hates socks and how they feel and will only wear trainers that are 2 sizes too big as her size 'feel tight'. Also getting her to wear sunscreen in the summer is an absolute nightmare!! she goes into a horrendously bad mood all day because I make her put it on to keep her safe in the sun but she can't stand the feel of it on her skin. She has never been an affectionate child, hugging her is, and has always been like hugging an ironing board. She goes completely stiff and moves away as quick as she can. I'm not really sure why I'm posting on here, I think its to get a feel for is it just me that thinks this? I've spoken to my husband about it and he agrees, but I feel like he just buries his head in the sand with it and hasn't got the energy in him anymore to fight her corner. His ex (stepdaughters mum) is, well, a nightmare basically. We have had to fight through the courts for many years to ensure we saw my stepdaughter as her mum stopped all contact for no reason when they split. I feel like I can't go to her to discuss my concerns as i know she wouldn't even entertain it. She absolutely hates me (for no reason other than because I was the new gf many years ago) and although my husband and I have been together for 9 years and have 2 other children, she acts like me and my daughters don't exist. Obviously with school now all online and only remote access, I don't know where to start in getting her assessed? She hides most of the traits quite well, and mainly appears as quiet and extremely introvert but as she's gotten older it's definitely becoming more apparent, im just not sure if school would be able to pick up on all of her traits without assessing her social interaction around school? Has anyone else been in this position that could possibly point me in the right direction? Its starting to cause a few issues at home as my 7 year-old can't understand why her sister treats her the way she does. Some days she will play in her room with her, lining up all of her lol dolls and making sure they have the correct outfits on etc and then the following day completely ignores her and won't speak a word. Thanks x\n",

      "Hi, I'm just after a bit of help/advice really. My son got referred to iscan for a possible attention deficit back in March (literally a few weeks before covid kicked off big time in the UK and I had my second baby). He has speech delay and before this referral he went to get his hearing checked just to rule out if that was anything to do with his delayed speech. His hearing was fine but the woman who was testing his hearing mentioned that maybe it was autism and that's why the health visitor came to see us. He definately has poor attention, I've always known this and because of this his learning is behind and he's not where other children his age are at. He's since started nursery school who have been amazing and have put different things in place to help him and I've signed an IDP. The teacher has also mentioned autism before (he went through a very short phase of tipping everything on its side). We've learnt that he won't be seen by ISCAN untill maybe April 2021 due to a backlog in cases because of coronavirus. I don't really know what I want out of this thread sorry 🙈 Does he sound similar to anyone else's child? I want to know what he has so that I know how to help, so that I would know what strategies to work and have a better understanding of how his brain works and why he's does the things he does. Does anyone know if going private is an option? He needs funding for a one to one in school. He also doesn't play a lot anymore. He just runs back and forth making noises. Has anyone got any ideas of what could keep his attention? Are there any toys you find your children like if they have attention issues? We have major issues at bedtime. Sometimes he can takes hours and then even more hours to get him to sleep. He always wakes once or twice in the night. My partner normally then goes in with him and just stays with him while I have the baby. He normally goes straight back to sleep. The other night however, he woke at 3 and would not go back to sleep untill half 5,he was wide awake!! This happens every now and again. Again, any tips welcome? Just any advice, help, any reply would help really! Thanks for listening!\n",

      "Hi Laura, I'm sorry to hear of your struggles. My daughter is 7 years old and we got a private diagnosis for autism is October. It cost £1700 so not cheap. We are now trying to get her assessed for ADHD. If I'm honest, from what you are saying about your son it sounds to me like ADHD. My daughter is hyper and struggles to get to sleep but we found phennagen tablets help. We usually crush one up in her juice so she isn't even aware as she has gagged when taking them and that put her off. The night time ones are not suitable for children and we had to say that the daytime ones that we giver her were for us to help us sleep. She doesn't have one every night, just every now and then. Sorry I can't be more help, but feel free to message if you want someone to chat too. There really is no support out there and its such a day to day struggle. Sarah xxx\n",

      "Hi everyone .. I have a newly diagnosed child with ADHD .. 3 children all together. As some of you may no bedtimes are a nightmare, my oldest keeps the younger ones awake for hours or if they fall asleep the oldest wakes them up with noise ect .. he/she even keeps me up all hours & will try anything to agitate the whole house .. keep coming down the stairs, flicking light switch on and off to the point I've had to remove the bulb ... Suddenly he/she decides to brush teeth at whatever time of night .. anyway I'm currently on the waiting list for a 3bed .. has anyone got a letter from a doctor to take to your housing group to say how much of an issue having an ADHD child in the same room as the other siblings is and has anyone been moved up a band or moved forward on the list ... Sorry if this post is long but it's the hardest thing to try and get the children settles at night and think it would improve greatly if ADHD child had own room ... Thankyou\n",

      "I’m a 54 year old grandmother who looks after my grandson with adhd and autism! His mother ( my daughter) died & years ago and I’ve brought him up since! I’ve fought and fought for years for his diagnoses and been to umpteen school meetings where he’s been excluded continuously that I homeschooled him for a year! I then got him in another school that accepted you when you turned 14 and he was removed after three weeks for hitting a teacher! He then got put in a pupil referral school and was continuously excluded! He’s now in college and fingers crossed doing ok! My remaining children hate him ! My daughter 25 and son 23 who has just moved out three weeks ago due to his behaviour! Last Wednesday I came in from shopping and he attacked me! It’s not the first time it’s happened! He attacked me because he attempted to attack my daughter after she told him to do something (trivial) I got in the way of them and he beat me up! I’m bruised all up my arms and back! Thus gas now happened a handful of times! I’m his full time carer and all I want to do is give him up! He’s nearly 17. I don’t work so rely on being his carer! I think bad thoughts all the time to escape him and spend a lot of time locked away in my room if he’s in the house and not at college and I’m alone with him! I hate him!

      "Hi sorry saw you didn't have a reply so couldn't not reply. How old is he? If he attends school or nursery speak to them and they can refer him for an assessment. Once the assessment is carried out they will discuss in further detail. For now I would say try and note his triggers, if he gets angry give him a pillow to hit & time away from others to cool down and when he's ready he can come back to you without making a thing out of it. I have found children with adhd also struggle with expressing how they actually feel, it can be gently extracted sometimes but you have to catch it before the anger begins. Also once you find something they are interested in this can be used for a variety of activities to help their attention span. For example if he likes dinosaurs, create 'trees' out of toilet rolls or paint some for them to walk through a forest, do some messy play some mushed weetabix for 'dinosaur food', blue cornflour for a river ect.... When practising counting use dinosaurs to count ect... But this all obviously varies upon his age but just some ideas. This is just from some experience as a ta but every child is different, persevere - you've got this!\n",

      "Hi My name is Angie and my son was about 18 months old when I realised he was different! He’s the youngest of 4. He’s now 11 and just two days ago started medication for ADHD. I fought for years to get some help but it was something that no one would really commit to. Then in year 4 I just went up to his teacher and asked her what she thought? She agreed there n then she thought he had adhd! It hit me like a brick wall, at last, someone believes! Cut a long story short, he’s now in yr 7 and a few months ago said to me he wanted meds so he could do better at school like the other kids. So that’s what we did! ( his dad doesn’t agree) I’m worried what affect the meds will have on him but I have to try this. It’s such a hard thing to deal with, you can see the way people look at your child, you hear the way they are treated by some disbelievers and it messes you up! Go with your gut! It’s your baby you have to protect and help them the best you can. 😘\n"

      "My son is almost 9 months old (will be on the 7th). He had a lot of trouble because I didn't make enough milk at the start of his life but I switched to mostly formula at 3 months and fully formula at 6 months (not by choice but because he hated boobs by then) and that's all behind us now. Last time he was weighed was about 2 weeks ago, they said he had lost weight. It was a big shock to me but he had been eating a bit less than usual and he'd also had a fever for a few days and eaten hardly anything then. It was almost like he was insulted because the next few days after that he ate like a champ, a whole pouch and a pudding every meal and I figured, great, it's all getting better. Since then though he's started eating less again, especially when he is tired he hates to eat but often he doesn't like eating. At breakfast he eats the most I guess because he is hungry from not eating in 12hrs. Lunch and supper are battle grounds, even at breakfast he doesn't eat as much as I feel he should, he'll eat a weatabix with some formula and most of a banana but not a whole banana like he did in those glorious worry free few days. Now at lunch if I offer him something homemade rather than a pouch he turns his nose up at it, it's a struggle to get him to eat a few bites and then he might eat a couple of bites of fruit or pudding but generally that's it, he's done. If I give him a pouch (expensive) he is usually more receptive, eats the whole thing but not a whole pudding. Similar at supper. I've been trying more finger food at supper because he is a very independent boy who wants to do everything himself, but unless you hand the bits of food one piece at a time he ends up throwing them all over the floor and not eating them and even if you hand him one at a time he might only get through say - one fish finger - worth of food. And again, a few spoonfulls of pudding. This involves sitting for a meal for over an hour. If he drank milk well I'd probably not worry, just give him extra milk. But no, milk is a struggle too. When he is tired I've got to physically restrain him to get him to drink his milk! He cries and wriggles to get free but from time to time is willing to take the bottle and eventually manages to drink it all. If he is not tired he's more receptive to milk, but once he drinks about half the bottle (3.5-4oz) he gets bored and tries to run away and doesn't really drink more or chews the teat and again it's a question of continuing to offer every few minutes for a while and enduring \"don't keep me still\" protests. I read all this stuff about just trusting their appetite and stuff, but he seems to have a really poor appetite all the time, when he is super hungry he wants to eat, but as soon as the edge is off he just wants to play and hates eating because it keeps him from playing. I am scared he's going to get brain damaged or something from undernutrition because he won't eat. He is extremely active, always on the go. Everyone says's he's close to walking. He cruises, he climbs stairs, he commando crawls (on rough or cold floors he can crawl on all fours but he doesn't prefer to). He is babbling. He is social. He loves attention. He high fives. He can pick out parts of my face (mummy's nose etc) on command. He comes when I say I'm going (but not always just when I say I want him to come lol :P). Developmentally he seems to be doing well. But feeding him is such a struggle. There's got to be a way to make him like eating. Lord knows both his parent's like eating (too much!) Why does he hate food :(\n",

When he was born he was 3.5kg when he was born which was around 50th percentile but he went down to the 9th early on and went back up to around the 30th once I stopped being in denial about my milk problems. Not sure what he's at now but there's definitely a dip in the curve.\n",

My brother was born when I was late 2 (I was born in may, he in jan) and I have some vague memories of before he was born, my mum being pregnant, asking me if I wanted it to be a boy or a girl, asking me what we should call the baby (Benjamin I insisted - my mother was adamant no, not Benjamin \"Benjamin means seventh son\"). Most of my memories include my brother though. I have very little sense of a time before.\n",

      "My son is 13 months, and honestly his speech is amazing, over 80 words (I did a quiz, I didn't manually count them honest), starting to put words together \"object gone\", really communicative. But there's some words that I'd expect that are just not there. Mummy is one of them. He is great at daddy. Says it super clear \"da-deeeeee\", points at daddy, or at the door if he isn't there (sometimes when his dad is at work he says \"da-dee door\" but mummy? Nope. But the one that really confuses me is - he doesn't say \"no\" - don't get me wrong, it's clear as daylight when he doesn't want something or like something - but I'm surprised that \"no\" isn't one of the first words he learned. He says \"yeh\" although I think more as an expression of excitement than of assent. Some paranoid part of me worries that these missing words indicate some problem, I don't know, some unusual learning disability or something. I know it's silly, but it just seems so weird to me that he can say \"curtain\" and not \"no\". Surely no is a lot more useful?\n",

      "I know it's totally uncouth and I know the right people to brag to are the grandparents but I already did that and I still feel an urge to brag. He is 13m. OK, he is getting closer to 14m now, he will be 14m on the 7th of Sept. He is amazing you guys. He slept 6hrs a night from birth. He started sleeping 12hrs a night at around 3m and since then slept 4hrs in the day, which he still does most days. He is a really happy cheerful little guy most of the time. He took his first unsupported steps at 10m. His first word was at 8m and by 11m he had around 20 words. Now he has closer to a hundred. He is starting to put words together in short phrases (mostly 2 word phrases so far). He has started using his first preposition (\"in\"). He is so energetic and full of life, he runs around everywhere now so excited holding out his hands, one formed into a point, the other just too excited to stay down by his side. He loves his balls, throwing them everywhere and chasing them, and when they go under things he tries to retrieve them with the broom (he's seen me do this so I can't claim he came up with it all by himself). At the playground (the little one not the big kid one) he climbs the equipment like a pro. He even tries to climb the slide, he worked out for himself he needs to keep his shoes on the slide because his clothes are more slippy than the slide and he almost got to the top. I was in awe. He knows his shapes, we listen to a song on youtube that goes \"a is for apple, a a apple\" etc and if you sing one letter he'll say the name of the word that comes next (e.g. if you sing \"a a apple\" he says \"broccoli\" if you sing \"m m monkey\" he'll say \"nuts\" - although I'm not claiming his pronunciation is great with any of this because it ain't). I don't get to meet other kids and compare much but whenever it happens I am amazed because I get so used to this just being what 13m olds are like and apparently not all of them - and yes I know it's bad to compare - and yes I know they'll all catch up to the same place eventually - but I love how my little boy is racing ahead right now, it fills me with so much pride and awe. I'm having a second in January. I have no idea what the new baby is going to be like, maybe the opposite, never sleeps, late for everything lol, natures revenge...

      "This is embarrassing but I went through this phase as a child. Teachers told me off, people made awkward noises. No-one ever explained to me that what I was doing was masturbation or that it's something people should only do in private. Everyone was clearly too embarrassed and didn't know what to say and was probably afraid to give me some kind of complex. I was a teenager before I realised what I was doing and how inappropriate it was. Explaining that to your child is probably going to be hard at age 2 but I think you'll have to find a way. Maybe talk about clothes and how as well as to keep warm we wear clothes to cover our private bits, and we also don't touch our private bits in public or in front of other people?\n",

He sat on it the whole way through a book today which was a first because he normally wants to get up after a few pages. I was thinking that during the October half term would be a good time to try because we can set aside a whole week to stay home and really nail it. I know he is very young - and I don't expect him to be dry at night or anything yet (or even pull his own pants down, I am happy to do that for now), but he is a very communicative little boy and he hates nappy changes so much I can't imagine it being worse.

      "Do you have a source on that, I've found a lot of conflicting studies claiming a massive range in time when a child learns to control their bladder from ::link_1:: to ::link_2::. But what does seem consistent about a lot of these things is it's not a purely developmental process but a learned skill, the more a child has to practice holding their wee - and voiding their entire bladder at once - the better they get at it. I guess my fear is if I leave it too long we'll hit the rebellious toddler phase - at the moment he is so compliant, if I ask him to tidy up his toys he does it, if I ask him to put his books back in his bookcase he does it, if he takes a toy off another kid and I ask him to give it back he will go give it back. I feel like once he is in the phase where he wants to do the opposite of everything I ask it will make things a lot harder.\n",

      "I can't drive yet. My son is 14 months old. In January I am having another baby and I want to get this sorted before then. My son has always been a good walker, first steps were at 10m and now he is pretty confident (some might say overconfident!). He still falls a lot if he is tired, but when he isn't tired he walks well. So I've started letting him out of the buggy to walk with me when we go on errands or to town or whatever. This is where my problem begins. Understandably a boisterous 14 month old has no sense of danger or of a need to stay with mummy. He wants to explore the world. He wants to touch everything - filthy shop shutters, dog poo, every single leaf in the world, stinging nettles, stones, tires, hubcaps - you name it. He does not want to be restrained. He hates going in the buggy. I always ask \"do you want to hold my hand or go in the buggy\" and he goes \"hand\" every time (he quite likes to push the buggy but not reliably enough to use that as a way to trick him into being contained). After a few days of this hand holding business and him several times when he decided he no longer liked the restriction to pull away so vigorously that I could hear his arm/hand joints clicking (nope nope nope!) I decided that hands were not reliable enough. So I got him some reins today. As soon as he was in the reins he tried to run away, of course since every action has an equal and opposite reaction and since he was on a tether, this caused him to fall over. The whole excursion today was him trying to run away despite the reins and being pulled over in consequence, getting deeply frustrated and crying about it and me eventually making him go in the buggy anyway because we weren't getting anywhere - hands were working better but they had the \"what if I dislocate his arm problem\" and a few times with the hands he managed to slip free and I'm deathly afraid he'll get run over one of these days. I don't want him in the buggy all the time because he really does love walking, and me and my husband are overweight and we would like him to avoid that fate and it seems the exercise is a good thing in that respect. People who've used reins - did the child eventually get used to them and stop trying to pull against them? How do you think I should handle this? I definitely don't think it will be easy to keep him safe holding hands once the new baby comes along.\n",

Even in safe places he seems so much braver than other children his age in terms of his willingness to leave my side and wander around quite far away from where I am. He doesn't seem concerned if he can see me and he is too young to listen to reason or take seriously warnings of dangers he has no direct experience of (and I am not willing for him to be run over so he knows not to run into the road!)\n",

I've been round both kind of house. It's mostly middle class people weirdly who have the dust houses (except when they have a cleaner) and working class people have beautiful spotless houses. I think working class parents show their kids how to clean - maybe it's such a normal part of life the kids don't even remember specifically being shown - and middle class parents are expecting their little darlings to be focusing on academics or something and then when we get into the world we're hopeless. My house was cleaner before the baby, but I still wasn't good at it. I never remembered stuff like skirting boards. I always forgot to crouch down and check if things looked clean from a lower angle and not just be \"it's fine\" because standing up it looked fine. When I am not wearing my glasses (which I do a lot and forget to put them on because they give me a headache) and I sweep I miss *so* much and then I put my glasses on and feel like \"why did I bother sweeping, the floor is still a state\". And things got so bad it feels hopeless wondering where to start. Do I start with the dust? Do I start with the stuff that fell under the sofa cushions? How about those skirting boards? And stuff like the walls - the walls drive me crazy, they have lots of dirt on them, especially by the dinging table but also from moving furniture around and stuff - but I have tried wiping them and it takes the paint right off and then I have horrible different coloured paint (or maybe that's the undercoat) seeping through.

Going through it with him I am amazed the words he picked up (I don't think he actually knows what they mean!) - on the page where the little princess tricks the potty and vis versa he says \"trrrrick!\" on the first page (\"nappies are YEUCH\") he goes \"yeuch!\" on the page where the potty is fun he goes \"fun\". He says some weird mixed together version of \"I want my potty\" (sounds more like \"awamipotty\"). Its really fascinating because I didn't think he'd really pick up words he didn't know the meaning of. Another word he's been really interested in lately is \"happy\", he says it a lot and I respond with a big smile saying it back, it's also from another book - maybe he thinks it means smile but there's no way to tell really is there? So I figured I'd try and explain to him that something is \"fun\" when it makes you happy so he can connect the two - he looked very interested in my explanation but I have no idea if it got through. No idea how I'd explain \"trick\" to him though :P It makes me wonder what else he's picked up from all the books he always makes me read - like he obviously knew and understood loads of nouns because he can say them and point at the picture - but all these other words are sinking in too! I guess reading to your kids really is good for their vocabulary. One thing I found super cute, especially because I remember having this book when I was younger, is when I asked him \"who's that?\" pointing at the little princess (who has straight brown hair like I do) he said \"mummy\". ^_^\n",

Everyone should pitch in, but the kids aren't the parents slaves, they're there to contribute not to do everything. It's the same with giving kids freedoms - one generation the parents are on the kids tails all the time monitoring everything and butting in, so the next generation goes to far and lets their kids go feral, then the cycle repeats.

He doesn't have a clue how to dismantle the remote thank god! He has gotten the hang of climbing now though so nothing anywhere is safe from becoming \"MESS!\"\n",

Sometimes I wonder if my son has ADHD because he just doesn't stop too, but it's just that they're young and full of pep. They'll probably mellow out as they get older.

      "So for at least a year now my husband has been moaning that I am deaf. I have insisted he just mumbles and he can hardly expect me to hear him when he has his face pointed away from me. Last week my parents visited and I complained I couldn't hear them because they were walking in front of me and thus had faces pointed away - they said that's a sign of hearing loss. I did an electronic DIY hearing test thing at specsavers and everything seemed fine but my husband said it won't pick it up because the headphones are right on my ears and it's not the same as the \"face turned away\" issue. I also find it hard to pick out sounds in a noisy environment, like if people are talking and there is a lot of background noise I find it hard to distinguish the sounds they are making in order to understand their speech, I find myself having to \"process\" the speech for a while in my head to work out what they might have said. I feel like it's been this way for a long time. I can feel that there is wax in my ears, like I can physically feel it's presence, I don't know if this is normal, but if it's not maybe the whole thing can be put down to wax buildup. Even gently brushing a q-tip in the top of the hole in my ear (yes I know you're not meant to put q-tips in your ears!) I get a lot of wax on it. It would be kind of amazing if it was just wax and I could get it cleared out and suddenly my hearing be better! That said I hear very well when it comes to annoying noises in bed when I am trying to sleep!! Do you think it's worth going to the doctor about this? Or is everyone just pulling my leg trying to make me feel like I am going deaf when it's normal?\n",

Maybe it would be useful if the two of you sat down, when you are both calm, and came up with a defined set of consequences for particular behaviours. I don't think there is intrinsically anything wrong with having high expectations for behaviour - but your husband is completely out of line swearing at them or calling them names. They are children learning how to behave not ******* or ********! Maybe he will feel more in control as well if he knows what consequences you've agreed for specific transgressions because he won't have to work it out in the heat of the moment when he is feeling angry. Maybe you could discuss strategies for dealing with anger at the kids - in the context of some new firm rules with fixed consequences so he doesn't feel like it's all just to let the kids off the hook - e.g. going to another room, taking some deep breaths and counting to 10 before making a decision about what to do with one of the kids. If he is happy to call them names then their relationship is probably really damaged right now - maybe discuss how you can address that too - organise some activities they can enjoy together, special daddy and the kids time where he can get to know them in a positive context outside of the pressures of their household duties.\n",

      "A couple of years back my husband got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I am not sure how far this goes back though, when I met him he was in a bad state as well because his mum had had a heart attack. Still I think things got worse when he got diabetes. Both he and his mum are quite high anxiety people with quite low self esteem. I wonder if this is because until he was about 5 his mum had an abusive (physically as well as emotionally) husband, or if it's coincidental to that. Last night he was freaking out because he lost his temper with a bus driver who drove the wrong route - this was during a hypo - the reality is, as much as he needs to be he is not 100% in control when he has a hypo, it's really not possible for his behaviour to be perfect and all he did was swear. Honestly if I'd been on a bus and the driver went completely the wrong way (despite selling tickets to people for stops on the correct route) I'd have been pretty aggravated and the bus driver compounded it by trying to lie it was a different bus (multiple passengers confirm it wasn't). Swearing might not have been the right way to react but it's not exactly beyond understandable. Anyway, he has been freaking out all night and all morning that he will get banned from the busses and then he will lose his job and he even said if he lost his job he would kill himself because he would be worthless - implying his only worth is to earn money for his family and that he has no other value. What really gets to me, I mean drives me completely insane, is I can understand his anxiety and getting freaked out by things that happen (although something is always happening that he can freak out about). But he beats himself up constantly, calling himself worthless, a loser, a failure etc To me that seems like something he could either not do or at least fight - like if he thinks to himself \"I'm a loser\" he could think \"no you know what I have achieved lots of things - yeah I am not the world's most successful person but neither is most everyone and I would never say everyone else is a loser\" or whatever - but he just says he deserves to be called a loser. On good days he is open to talking about it and he says when he read the description of \"pure O\" OCD he thought it sounded just like him, sometimes he says he thinks he is depressed. But then when it's a bad day he kicks in his heels and says he deserves to feel bad - or says that he would lose his job if he got diagnosed with anything so he should just suffer in silence. I said to him the other night it's like I live with 3 people. Our beautiful son, my wonderful husband and an evil bully who is always berating my husband and beating him into the ground. I want to kick the bully out! This morning he asked me if I really thought he should see a GP and asked if I would go with him (of course I said yes). I do wonder what would happen - I know if they say the wrong thing to him or make him feel like it's pointless we'll be back to square one. I don't think he wants to go on medication if he can help it but I think he's open to talking therapy. I guess I don't know why I am writing this... just how can I support him? Do you think he will ever feel better? Can we ever evict the bully for good?\n",

I doubt he’ll ever have a real job or friends or a relationship or live independently. My son is pretty advanced. He is 15 months has started using sentences, he rote counts to (as of today 7, was 6 before today), he loves letters, he loves books and being sung to. Tbh there’s nothing really that makes me worry too much but: - he does the thing where he uses my hands, puts them on a toy so I operate it, claps them, uses them to point with, puts things in them that he wants me to use. However he does verbalise requests for help a lot too. - if he is doing something he is focused on he doesn’t pay any attention if you talk to him, say his name or ask him questions. Other times though he responds fine. - he is constantly quoting from books or just talking about stuff he’s heard before, makes me think of delayed echolalia. Talking about stuff that isn’t there with no context apart from he is remembering the book or song or whatever. - he seems way more independent than your average child and always has, at 5m when he learned to commando crawl he was off, wanted to do everything for himself, get everything for himself. As he got older he got a bit more affectionate but he is still very much a “do it self” kind of kid. He will go a terrifying distance away from me. I used to be able to get him to come with me by saying “ok bye. Mummy is going this way” but now he just says “bye” - he’s young yet but he doesn’t seem that social in his speech content. Like he does direct your attention to thinks he wants to share “Dog! Dog! Woof!!” But he never (apart from aforementioned context) says hi or bye, he never waves, he doesn’t talk for the sake of the social interaction it feels like but always to talk about stuff that interests him (animals, numbers, letters, songs, books) or to ask for help/food/singing/reading. It’s hard to explain really. - there’s something about other babies of a similar developmental level (rather than age). They seem similar to my son except they seem much better socially somehow.

He would get so tired, and he was obviously tired (big eyebags, red eyebrows, cranky etc) and a short period of doing controlled crying (like after a week he cried for 5 minutes, after a couple of weeks he didn't cry) he discovered he could suck his thumb and started having naps in the day.

My plan (and I followed through!) was to basically stay in bed for the first 6 weeks after having a baby (won't be quite as able to do that this time because I have a toddler to take care of). You shouldn't expect any kind effort from yourself for at least that amount of time. And relax, you'll have plenty of time to cook and clean and meet friends later. The best time is between age 3 months and whenever they learn to crawl. That time is great, they just lie there you can put a baby gym or something or put them in one of those bouncing chairs and they happily bat their hands around and coo while you get on with your life. Once they start crawling they need to be watched like a hawk because they will systematically attempt to dismantle your entire house but thankfully by then they're usually settled into a nap schedule and you can get things done when they're napping. My firstborn got on the crawling bus when he was 5 months old and walked at 10m.

If he starts ranting about work say \"I can see you're very stressed about this right now, it's making me feel very stressed too and I need a breather\" and just leave the room - even go out for a walk somewhere. Agree in advance that if either of you decide to go away (different room or out) to calm down the other won't follow or try and carry on the discussion. This helped us a tonne. Just agreeing to give each other space when needed because before that we'd keep trying to \"fix\" the angst by pouring on more angst and making it worse. 2. Get his blood sugar checked - turned out my husband had diabetes. This probably won't happen to you but you want to know if it is. Or just get a general health check, lots of physical conditions can cause mood swings.\n",

      "A full time manual job is really hard. I do honestly think you're expecting too much of him. Especially at his age (a lot of men are just not confident with babies). Maybe you can frame things a little differently for him though - he needs to bond with his child - one day a week he could take the child, unsupervised (him not the child :P) while you sleep, for 3-4 hours - doesn't have to be during the night even, just a chance to nap in the day. During those 4 hours you are not to be woken unless there is a house fire or the carbon monoxide tester goes off. This is not just for your sake but because he needs to be confident watching his child on his own and develop his own style of care taking. On that last note it's vitally important if he thinks its a worthwhile idea that you never criticise how he takes care of the child during that time. He is the parent as much as you, yes it's a learning curve and he will have to learn just like you did when you brought them home. If you hear crying or other noises and worry the child is distressed with daddy you mustn't come running because it will completely shatter his confidence that he can watch the child on his own and he will feel completely justified in leaving it all up to you. Unless he is smoking crack in front of her or something you just have to let him make his own decisions and take responsibility for them. Wear earplugs if you have to.\n",

I did a life expectancy calculator and I'd live to 86 if I was normal weight and active - but sedentary and fat I'll live to 74! That really puts it in perspective!

I'd love to have a bunch of friends who also like to sing who could get together and sing songs with more than one part together. I don't want to do performances or anything, just get together and enjoy singing together, maybe going to each others houses to do it and once a year going camping and singing round the fire. I'd love that so much. I have no idea how to achieve that, most people are very shy about singing, even in private and a lot of people do not feel confident at all at learning the harmony parts (because if you get it wrong it sounds awful I guess! :P but you can get it right without learning it perfectly by listening for the harmony and quickly adjusting your note!!!). I can't think of a single thing that would make my life better than having people to sing with. I want to sing folk and world music. The dark hours of winter make me feel more and more like that would be a wonderful thing to do. Makes me feel so lonely.

      "My main motivation is I had a terrible time in school because I was never the kind of person to fit in. My husband did too. My dad, my mum, my brother, all the same. I think genetically we're all just a bunch of weirdoes and our kids will probably follow in our footsteps and so why would I put them through that? School was hell for me, I thought I was depressed for most of my life and then I left school and I realised I actually loved life, wasn't depressed, just hated school. I was so lonely at school because I didn't fit in. But out in the \"real world\" you aren't forced to only talk to people the same age, or to sit alone for an hour because it's \"break time\" and no-one wants to play with you. If no-one wants to play with you where you are, you can go somewhere else and meet people that you can make friends with (I had lots of friends out of school from e.g. drama class, music theory class, scouts etc - it was only in school with all the cliques and stuff that I was lonely). I also think that the education system is so one size fits all but all children are individuals, I want my kids to have the opportunity to learn at their own pace - whether that's slower or faster than the national curriculum (and it will probably be both in different subjects) and to choose subjects that are relevant to their goals instead of a fairly cookie cutter set of subjects. Obviously the basics are important for everyone (literacy, numeracy etc) but beyond that it's dependent on what they want to do in life. Finally I am (as uncool as it is in Britain) a Christian (Eastern Orthodox) and I want to structure the school year around the Orthodox calendar which is different to the Western Christian calendar. I want them to have more downtime and time for prayer and meditation during lent - so that will be our big \"holiday\" from academic work. I want to celebrate the saints of each day with them and for that to be an integral part of our life not just something tacked on before or after school. But this is a new reason because I wanted to homeschool before I converted to Christianity.\n",

I have no idea how many words he has now at 16 months but he makes sentences with some missing words (“Noise a cow make, moo” “daddy’s here mummy’s here” “where a poppy?” “Sing petticoat mummy!” (Petticoat is his name for a particular song that has the word petticoat in) “read the book” “throw the ball” etc. I sometimes think he has pretty advanced speech but then online you get two kinds of parents - the ones who are worried about unmet milestones and the ones whose kids could compose sonnets at 8 months old. When I go online I feel like my kid isn’t very advanced in his speech but when we go out and meet real people I feel like he is. I think his social skills are much weaker than the kids 18-24 months old that we meet though even though physically and speech wise he is doing great.\n",

It has no effect on academic achievement till age 3 for non disadvantaged children. It does increase emotional volatility and behavioural problems in both groups before 3 but not after 3. But and this is a massive BUT both effect sizes are small and are grossly overshadowed by the effects of parenting whether a child goes to nursery or not. The government can’t make uneducated parents into academics or professionals so it has to go with the lesser effect size of early education.\n",

He has two stacking ring puzzles, one is a lighthouse from IKEA which he never does \"right\" (stacks them in whatever order he likes which is never biggest to smallest) and a toy with 5 columns of rings, each column a different colour and with ascending numbers of rings (so one blue ring in the first column, then two green rings in the second etc). He now does that one perfectly, occasionally he is about to put the wrong colour on the wrong column but he checks himself and moves it to the right one, it's actually pretty impressive.

I think he is capable of learning to use the potty. He likes the idea of no nappies but he doesn't like the potty or the toilet. I know he can hold in his wee and his poo because if I let him run around naked he doesn't wee or poo and if I sit him on the potty he doesn't either. Occasionally he does wee without a nappy but never poo anymore (used to when he was younger). I can get him sitting on the potty for a whole hour and he doesn't even let out a trickle, even if I ply him with water. He's weed once or twice on the potty all months ago. He has never pooed on it. He is resistant to the idea of sitting on the potty or toilet without an immediate reward (watching a video, getting a sweet etc) and likewise to staying on it. He is interested in it and likes to play with it but not to sit on it. If I get him to sit on it for a long time eventually he goes \"need a pooooooooo!!!\" and freaks out and refuses to stay on it and gets upset and wants a nappy. I was thinking of trying just going cold turkey, nappies don't exist anymore except at bed and nap time. But I am worried that then he will ruin his sleep by doing his poos then.\n",

Then this morning he was trying to eat his breakfast (didn't want to sit on the potty even for a minute which made me think he needed a poo because he's been nervous to poo on it) and he kept complaining that this or that hurt and we narrowed it down to bum and belly. Yep needed a poo. I just kept reminding him over and over that if he poos in the potty he'll get 3 skittles and then I - rather gross I know - put his breakfast in front of the potty which made him much happier and he sat on it, ate the breakfast (ew) and very shortly - a poo was done in the potty! I was so happy. He CAN do it. Now I know it's possible it's just a matter of practice. So no crow for me :D And oh wow it's easier to wipe his bum when he poos in the potty (even if I do have to clean the potty too).\n",

      "About two weeks ago my child aged 2 had HFM. He recovered well and I breathed a sigh of relief no one else caught it. On Friday I woke up with a sore throat on one side. My tonsil was swollen and red with angry visible capillaries. I felt ok in myself though. Saturday I felt awful. Swollen glands, both tonsils now red and swollen. Feverish. Killer headache and neck ached from glands. Weak couldn’t much get out of bed. This lasted 2 days and then I felt much better with a slight sore throat and slightly swollen glands that were tender to the touch. By today I felt myself, glands are still tender to touch. Today husband had same symptoms. I didn’t connect it to HFM. Tonight I had a painful tongue spot. I’ve got them time to time before. I looked at it in the mirror and noticed my tonsils have white spots on them. One of the spots has a red ring around it. It was this point I wondered if we did catch the HFM after all. I have no spots anywhere else but I noticed in passing and assumed it was just a cut or blemish that my husband had a red spot on one of his fingers. I guess by tomorrow we’ll know if any more spots arrive. But what does the internet think? Hfm? Or just a random bout of infectious tonsillitis? If it’s hfm at least I can reassure myself the child already had it.\n",

My mouth is developing more sores as time goes on, his tonsils are covered in the white blister things. Out of hours thought it was strep but he neglected to mention our son recently had HFM and the spots on his tonsils are all perfectly round. Noticed a few blisters on the baby (7 month old rather than the 2 year old). Anyway here is my ode to HFM My mouth is full of sores, It’s really quite a bore. My husband has it worse He had to phone the nurse! The fever’s gone away But the pain is here to stay. I hope we get well soon, We’ve all been ill since June!\n"
