We went through a re assessment of his statement, it was agreed for other LA's to see if they could meet his needs and all 5 neighborouing authorities couldn't for one reason or another, after meeting him I may add. I also spoke to a few independant schools to see what they had to offer. Got back to the authority with a few ideas of how to progress, told them it would be much cheaper to offer a service at home rather than going to tribunal and me winning, hence the strong position I'm in. So hopefully soon he will be educated at home 3 full days per week.\n",

      "Hi I'm 38 and 18 weeks pregnant with baby no 4. I had my first 2 who are now 11 & 12 much younger and thought I was done, especially as I had DS & DD. Then I got divorced 8 years ago and met my husband now 3 yrs ago. He is also great with my kids but I always knew he wanted some of his own. So in Jan this year I gave my birth to another little boy :) As I didn't want him to feel like an only child (older 2 will be teenagers and off doing their own thing in a few years) we decided on baby no 4! Due in April and there will be 15 mths between them. I was worried about age, and starting again etc etc. But now I have him it's all perfect. Hes gorgeous, the kids adore him and are a great help, and I feel much more relaxed this time round. Also, as the older 2 are growing up, its lovely to have a baby in the house again. The positives far outweigh any negatives. Good luck, hope all goes well and here's to a BFP and a lovely bundle of joy at the end of it!\n",

I dont think u should just try for a particular sex but if you would be just as happy with a girl again if you didn't get a son go for it. My 2 youngest are very close especially since the oldest two only live with me half a week, the 4yr old was quite lonely when they went back to their dads and she was on her own with us but now she has her brother all the time\n",

There is such a horrible stigma attached to you trying for a baby over 40. It's sort of become accepted if you're still in your 30's but it's that dreaded four 0 that has everyone reeling with shock. But I am so broody, for the first time in my life. I was married for ten years to a bloke who never wanted kids and I accepted that. We are now divorced and I'm engaged to a great bloke who, although has two grown up children from his first marriage, has no qualms at becoming a dad again in his mid 40's. We've been trying like mad and I'm now into my 2ww, how frustrating... arghhhh, I just want to do the preg test - lol...

So what are the rules on folic acid? If I start taking it again now will it be the same as starting from scratch and taking it for 3 full months before trying to conceive or if I start taking it again now will the past few weeks still count?!

Yesterday I started to bleed very very very lightly more like spoting and I thought my period had come a bit early as I am a little iregular. I normaly would be bleeding very heavely by now but still only have less then yesterday- hardly any. This morning on my way out to work I just felt really nauseas and had to run home to throw up but then afterwards I felt fine and have felt only a little bit nausea after eating the rest of the day. Out of pure frustration of not understanding what the hell my body was doing I took a preg test this eve and there was a v v v faint second line. I know you guys cant say for sure but do I sound Preg and should I test gain and is it ok that I have bleed a bit and what if I bleed more? Thanks all Han\n",

I use the period tracker app on my iPhone and it has worked out I have an average 25 day cycle, if I go by this I am 4 days late for AF. If I go on a 28 day cycle I was due AF yesterday...I have had symptoms nearly 2 weeks now, all of which I haven't had any other month, but have still had BFN's on tests I have done (including one tonight) Anyway, hopefully my body will work out what it wants to do soon, I want to stay in the loop on here as I think it's a very positive support group and wish everyone luck and baby dust :)\n",

      "Hi everyone :) I've been lurking here for months seeing all the amazing support you give each other and now I'm starting my ttc journey I have finally joined properly. I'm 30 and got married last year, DH and I have been together since I was 19. We never really talked about kids because neither of us like them much, but a couple of years ago I discovered that despite that, biology still takes over and provides that fierce desire to reproduce that can't be surpressed. Poor DH was a bit shocked. I've been on the pill for 12 years and when I got my last 6 months from the doc I told DH that it would be the last lot, and he had six months to get his head around it. Sounds a bit brutal but I couldn't wait for him to be competely up for it or it would never happen. He is slowly coming around to the idea though, which is a relief. So I took my last pill just over a week ago, had my withdrawal bleed and today we had our first ever unprotected sex. For now my excitement about ttc has to be kept quiet so as not to freak DH out, so I take my pregnacare on the quiet and probably any testing will be done in secret, for now at least. Anyone else in a similar position? Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself as I will probably be around a lot over the coming months. F x\n",

I had so many symptoms..and I wasn't even symptom spotting :/ I had back ache, really bad bloating, tender boobs and a god awful mood on me..but I wasn't pregnant. Funny how I've never had any of these symptoms before and all of a sudden when ttc I do! Anyway because my periods are all over the shop I decided to buy ovulation test. I tested positive on the 23rd (afternoon ) and felt the cramping in the evening. We were down to business on the 21st late that night. So almost 2 days before the positive test. It's now 8dpo. I've had cramping since I ovulated which is something new to me.had shooting pains down there one day but it's been pretty much pressure pain. My back is hurting today and my boobs were killing me yesterday. I also woke up with a cold sore which I haven't had since I was about 6..obviously this is a sign my immune system is low. Also I've had the strangest dreams :/ very odd. I don't usually dream anyway but if I do I never remember them. These are almost real like. Anyway I'll stop waffling on..sorry Any thoughts or anyone who has had symptoms similar would be good to hear from. Thanks :)\n",

I went out shortly after taking the test and when i returned 5 hours later there was a thick pink line. So using the same urine I tested again. To start with it was negative and then I went out to buy more tests. Again well after the 10 minute time limit there was another thick pink line! The CB digital said not pregnant and the FR test didn't show a line. I know after the time limit I should disregard the result but if that had appeared within the time frame I'd be convinced I was pregnant. I've retested today with second urine using a cheap midstream test from B&M and I am certain there is a very faint second line within the time frame. As soon as I finished peeing I could see the line! But it's super faint! I don't know how to post pics from my phone as there isn't an attachment option otherwise I'd have shown you the Internet cheap tests.

Not only do I have PCO but DH has abnormalities with his sperm count (appointment tomorrow to find out what) Last month my cycle lasted 30 days. I had just started taking prenatal vits a friend recommended & thought they may have contributed but I am currently on CD36 & no period however my boobs have been agony for the last week or so. That & tiredness are my only symptom. I am as sure as I can be I ovulated back around CD16! I have taken multiple tests over the last week & all negative. I don't temp any more but will take it tomorrow to see if that indicates anything? I was wondering has anyone out there been in a similar position with negative tests and maybe gone on to have a BFP? I have had period pains however only lasted 10 mins & so mild. Not particularly irritable as I would be leading to AF.

      "Hi netmums I am so confused at the moment I feel like my brain will explode!! I'm hoping that writing it down plus your advise might help. Here goes... Ds1 born 1997 - emergency section, 4 days overdue, foetal distress Dd1 born 1998 - section, 10 wks early, IUGR Ds2 born 2009 - section booked for 39 wks but went into labour 38+5, quick labour (3 hrs) so no time for section, born by ventouse. I was so thrilled as I hadn't liked the idea of an elective section and it was all so exciting and unexpected!! Fast forward to now. I am pregnant again and worked hard to convince my consultants to let me try for another VBAC. Eventually they agreed. They warned it would probably be early and quick again and I would need constant monitoring. If I did go overdue they would let me go to 41 wks but couldn't induce me so section it would be. I was happy with that as I was sure it would be early. Got to 36 wks and suffered from SPD. Painful and very uncomfortable. After 2 wks in agony my consultant said the option for section was still there and eventually I agreed to book it for 40+1 wks. I was still so sure it would come before but felt better mentally with a back up plan! I am now 39+5 days and nothing!! Not a twinge or anything. Just pain from spd. The section is fast approaching and I'm getting cold feet. I don't know whether to wait til 41 wks now having come this far and hope baby comes by then, or just have the section next week. What if I wait til 41 wks and still have section. I'll have suffered an extra week for no reason. What to do???!!! Being my 4th child I was so sure it would be early. Never for a minute did I consider I would get to 40 wks or over ESP given what happened only last year. Just need some feedback...\n",

I have to sit in room until he folks asleep. He doesn't need me to hold him or anything, just sit there. If I try to leave as he is drifting off he starts to sit up and start screaming again. He doesn't wake in the night, but is up at 5.30-6am and screams til I get him at 7am. Same with daytime naps. I have no idea what's happened. Nothing has changed at all.

      "Hi Apologies in advance for the long post but I'm going to try and add all details of my concerns. I first started worrying about DS when he was 12 mths. I noticed he wasn't responding to his name and then realised his eye contact was a bit amiss (been fine to that point). He also wasn't clapping or waving at this point. Spoke to HV who referred him for hearing test which came back clear. HV recommended spending some 1:1 time with him (he's the youngest of 4!) and shed review at 18 mths. At 18 mths he'd only just started clapping and waving but no pointing. Eye contact was still hit and miss, responded to name say 60% of time and had no spoken words although babbled incessently. I also became concerned that he didn't seem to understand much of what I said. Pushed for SALT referral and development assessment from community paed as I started to worry about ASD. Got appt for both at 21 mths. Paed signed him off saying his development was on target or above for all areas except speech and language. SALT saw him and agreed to put him on their list for sing and sign therapy at 23 mths which he is now so waiting for appt date. He will be 2 on 13th April and still says no words apart from 'addy' when his dad comes in from work. Basic understanding of routines such as bedtime, bathtime, dinner time but if I said 'where's mummy or daddy' then nothing! He happily plays with all toys, no strange behaviour, some imaginative play, cognitive play is good. Germ my attention by pulling my arm, taking my hand etc. Still doesn't point, and doesn't look where I'm pointing either. I'm still worried about ASD and keep being told that although he's far too young diagnose now anyway, they are not concerned with that being the issue. They believe its a receptive language delay which is having a knock on effect on expressive language, as well as the non verbal cues - pointing etc. We are also now seeing a private speech therapist (2 sessions in) whilst waiting for NHS appointment. I guess what I'd like to know is if anyone was in a similar situation and it did resolve or did you go on to have a ASD diagnosis. Or anyone in a similar situation now and his they're coping.

He is severely S&L délayed. His understanding is very delayed, he only seems to understand one/two word sentences and instructions. He has a few words and phrases he can say but most are just repeated parrot fashion. It's been assessed as being around 15-18 mths stage. He is also being assessed for ASD due to showing some traits like lack of eye contact, delayed imaginative play. They aren't sure if its an SLI or ASD. My question is have any of you parents had children who had limited speech and understanding as toddlers and did it improve as they got older. I can't ever imagine him understanding what I say and fear he'll always be like a baby with his S&L whilst everything else develops normally :-(\n",

      "Hi everyone My little boy is nearly 3 and is currently being assessed for autism. The main signs are his significant speech and language delay, lack of eye contact, limited imaginative play. His understanding of language is very delayed - assessed at around 15-18 mth level. His speech is very delayed too. He has lots of words/phrases he can say but they are mostly copied and not really used appropriately in conversation. So, for example, he can name lots of animals and make their sounds but won't talk about them. He doesn't really ask for anything if he needs it but rather pulls me by the hand. He can name many objects but no connectives or verbs. So you can't have a conversation with him at all. My question is - when people describe their ASD children as non verbal what exactly do you mean? Can they say nothing at all? Or are they like my DS in that they can't have a conversation? Thanks for reading x\n",

      "Hi My son aged 3 has s&l delay and is being assessed for ASD. From 11 weeks until 3 weeks ago he has always slept like an angel. I could put him down at 7pm and he would settle himself. He would then wake around 6am and quietly chat/play in his cot until 7am when I went to get him. 3 weeks ago he woke up at 1am screaming and I went to him. He wouldn't settle so I ended up lying on his floor and holding his hand through the cot bars until he fell asleep about an hour later. I thought it was a fluke and thought no more of it. The next night it happened again and this time he didn't re-settle for 3 hrs during which time if I tried to leave his room he would scream blue murder! It's then continued since. He started climbing out of his cot and running around crying in the middle of the night so I moved him into toddler bed and put a gate on his door. Now I have to sit in his room when I take him up at 7pm until he falls asleep. Then he can wake anything between 2-4 times a night. Each time he gets out of bed, opens his door, stands by his gate and cries until I go back in. He'll then settle back fairly quickly. He doesn't want a cuddle or pat on back or anything - he just needs me in the room. I have now moved a mattress down there and some nights if I'm really tired from the constant waking I'll just sleep in there in the corner. On those nights he doesn't wake again! Any ideas on what could have caused these or any tips on how to solve this?? Thanks\n",

      "Hi, I could really do with some advice. Me and my hubby have been trying (ish) for about 4 months now and over the last couple of days my body has been being v v odd and I am wondering if I could be preg. Yesterday I started to bleed very very very lightly more like spoting and I thought my period had come a bit early as I am a little iregular. I normaly would be bleeding very heavely by now but still only have less then yesterday- hardly any. This morning on my way out to work I just felt really nauseas and had to run home to throw up but then afterwards I felt fine and have felt only a little bit nausea after eating the rest of the day. Out of pure frustration of not understanding what the hell my body was doing I took a preg test this eve and there was a v v v faint second line. I know you guys cant say for sure but do I sound Preg and should I test gain and is it ok that I have bleed a bit and what if I bleed more? Thanks all Han\n",

However there are some areas that I could really do with some advice on. 1) Would I get isolated, at the moment I work in a close team and I am worreied if I became a childminder I would lose the benefits of working with others.. 2)How do/did you build up your client base? I was hoping to use NCT, facebook etc to advertise. 3) Do I have to be able to drive? I cant drive atm and even if I learnt I would not have access to a car, however that said I am in a town with good bus links and nice country parks etc near by 4) How much does it cost to set up? Would people be worried that I have a dog? 5) What about holidays, What about when i get preg with my second? Sorry lots of questions, I am just trying to work out if this is really the route I want to go down. The main things that attracts this career to me is that I will be able to look after my LO at home alongside looking after other children, this will give LO benfeit of daycare, such as playing with other children but also means I dont have to leave him to go to work.

Anyway I have written up some pros and cons...... Pros of working (part time) · Money · Adult company · Will have something to go back into once child is in school. · Will not damage career so much Pros of being a SAHM · No child care costs · Being mum to child and spending crucial first years with child · Child not being looked after by someone else · Have chance to take child to activities that could help in there development · No stress of work · Having the opportunity to volunteer and possibly find new career ideas. · Shorter hours for child...can install routine · Chance to keep house clean · Chance to meet other parents. What I really want to do Cons of working Work is already slowly breaking me....so stressull · Child care costs- will it out way benefit of working · Not spending time with my child · Having child looked after by someone else · Long hours for child · Not really enjoying work · Not putting in 100% into work as want to be with child · Could miss child’s developmental milestones. · Being so tired from work that I can’t look after child in eve Cons of being a SAHM · Possible less adult company in less I put myself out there · Could be harder to find work when I want to go back · Could get board · Not getting paid · Could damage my career – may have to retrain. (would that nessarly be a bad thing?) I really dont know what to do? I am not really expecting people to make the decsion for me but just to give me your views on both being a working mum and a stay at home mum.....OH says i need to bring in £400 a month....I could do this just by cleaning some friends houses...I just dont know Please dont turn this into a massive fight between SAHM and working mums, the pros and cons relate to me its not the same pros and cons for everyone else.

Just a bit of background...I have been REALLY sick with this pregnancy....signed off work....fainting....not being able to get out of bed....sick multiple times a day, could not eat or drink (Hypermesis Gravidarum). My OH looked after me those 4 months...he had to do pretty much everything for me....and I had to be totaly relaint on him....this was not easy on either of us....however he knew that I would do the same for him if I was in this situation. Before I fell preg I organised a trip to Wales with some friends and we were in the process of moving house. superisinly enough when it came to moving house the house was not clean....OH was working full time...looking after me and I was near enough bed bound....so cleaning did not get done. \"Friend\" said that house was dirty and that I should not have baby if I could not keep the house clean and that morning sickness was all mind over matter....even tho she knew full well it was more then that. She also said I should not be takeing the meds the doc gave me as I was damerging my baby. However what upset me the most and what I am unsure if I can fogive this is that she said I was treating my OH like **** because I was not looking after him and helping him. She said that when we went to Wales he looked so tired and fed up....At wales I was there spent most of it in bed/sofa..only went as OH wanted to climb mountin and we organsised it so would cause so much trouble if we canceled. OH was tired and fed up at the time....he was looking after me when I was ill, pucking and unsure if baby would be ok....he was having to do more of his fair share of work...Jon said I was not treating him like **** and that he knew if the postion was swaped I would do the same for him. I basicly told her to **** off. I was so cross that she said I was harming my baby by takeing meds, I was so cross that she I was basicly being lazy when I was so very ill and I was so cross that she said I was treating my OH like **** when I was letting him look after me (not that I had any choice) Anyway today I woke up and she texted me saying she was sorry, she said that she did not mean to hurt my feelings and that she was just thinking I should do something for my OH once in a while as when he was at wales he looked so fed up and tired. I dont really know what to say to her. Half of me thinks I dont want her around me...she is so judgemental and that when baby is born house is not gonna be very clean for a bit and I will be very tired and if I have a C section she is not gonna be a good infulence around me. The other half of me thinks that this is a petty thing to fall out over and that I should fogive her...she clearly does not understand how ill I was but thats not her fault and she is not a mum and has never been preg. I feel like asking her if she was so worried about my OH why on earth did she not call him and talk to him? We both could have done with that support! I am now at the point were I am a little bit better now having normal moning sickness at 24 weeks!....I am back at work JUST, I can do a bit of cleaning and can get out of bed and I am starting to do more for Jon and for me. Would you fogive this? Do you think she was just being navie and stupied?\n",

      "Hey all, does my birth plan look to long? is there anything in there that is unrelastic/going to **** off M/W? its my first child so dont really know what to expect. B]Birth Preferences for our baby[/B] The safety of me and my baby are the most important thing My husband and my doula will be present, I do not want to be left alone without husband or Doula under any circumstances. I would ideally like to give labour and give birth at home. I would like to use the birthing pool, labouring and giving birth in the pool. Please do not offer me pain relief. I know what is available and will ask for it if I need it. I would like as much privacy as possible. If my eyes are closed/blindfold on, please do not interrupt me. I would like the lights to be dimmed – bright lights can give me migraines Please remind me to go to the loo to empty my bladder every hour. I would like to remain as active as possible, finding the best positions for me and changing these as I wish. I would like to try to rest between contractions where possible. I would like monitoring of baby to be kept to a minimum and I do not want vaginal examinations unless there is cause for concern. Please use a hand-held sonic aid and not continual monitoring. If you do have to examine me please do not tell me how dilated I am. I would prefer no interventions (e.g. breaking waters) unless a medical emergency precipitates them. I would like information about any proposed medication before receiving it: the purpose, potential side effects on me/the baby and options on timing e.g. before or after the baby is born. I would like to use hypnosis/TENS/water/massage/gas and air during my labour. I do not want anyone to offer me any pain relief. I would like to find an upright, comfortable position for pushing. Advice will be welcome. I do not want to push lying on my back unless medical vital. I wish to know when the head is crowning. I would appreciate firm advice and guidance at this time to guard against tearing. I do not wish to have an episiotomy unless medically vital or I agree to it. I would like to pick up the baby and I would like skin to skin contact and to put our baby to my breast as soon as possible, ideally to find the breast itself. I would like any help in positioning the baby for breast feeding you can offer. I wish the cord to remain attached until it stops pulsating. My husband would not like to cut the cord. I don't mind who does If I have had a natural birth, I would to try a physiological third stage. If a tear occurs I want to be advised whether or not I need to be stitched and I will then choose whether or not I need a local anaesthetic. I wish to be stitched by an experienced midwife or doctor. I do not mind one student observing/assisting with my birth so long as they are supervised. Needing to be transferred I would like either my husband or doula to come with me in the ambulance to offer me reassurance Please try and keep everything calm and offer me lots of reassurance Please be honest with me about the reasons I need to be transferred I only want to be transferred if me or my baby is in danger. Emergencies My husband and I will discuss all eventualities as they arise. Please share any concerns with us as soon as they arise and be honest with us about the risks involved. Before we make a decision we It will help us to know the answers to these questions: 1. Is baby or me in danger? 2. What is wrong? 3.What do you suggest and why? 4. What would be the best possible outcomes with and without this intervention? 5. How much time do we have to make a decision? 6. Are there any other courses of action open to us? Caesarean I would like my husband to be present If possible I would like baby first voice it hears to be mine I would like baby to be placed onto me, if this is not possible I would like me husband to have skin to skin contact. If baby and me are separated I would like my husband to stay with baby and gill to be with me to support me, I DO NOT want to be left alone without husband or my Doula. I have seen C-Sections performed and am pretty scared of them. Please try and keep theatre as calm as possible and offer me lots of reassurance. Ventouse/forceps I really do not want forceps if the situation arises please try and use Ventouse first. Please keep the environment as calm as possible and offer me lots of reassurance\n",

      "Hi all just looking for advice so the back story is I have two ds 9 and 5 so my ds9 stayed at my mums Sunday night there he had a play gun which has string in it and u have to to pull it and it pops anyway he came home Monday morning with a circle on his face and other bruises around it I was shocked and ask my mum and she said he was on his iPad whilst pulling the gun by his face. I was horrified he went to school with my mum and she explained and took the gun to show the teacher everything was fine. I then took him to school on Tuesday and I also took the gun to the receptionists as the teacher the day before was supply. As he went in the deputy head was there and said I heard about this so o showed her the gun and she explained to my son on what has happened to the blood vessels anyway today my ds5 is autistic and wasn't feeling very well so he wasn't in school I rang the school to ask if they can tell my ds9 if he could run home and I would be waiting by the wall by our houses which I can see his classroom door from there and my back door is about 15 steps away.anyway my ds dad came home from work and just popped in to see my ds as he was ill and I said will u wait there while I go to the wall and wait for my other son and that was fine I see the classroom door open and I see my son there and I'm waving to him and I can see him pointing to me and he was just waiting there so at about 3.28 I started walking towards the gates and my son was running threw crying I said what's wrong and a teacher from the school told him he wasn't allowed to leave to which I said I rang and told them I will be waiting. Hd said I told them mum that my mums there I can see her and my little brother is most probably at the house so I need to go quickly.. Him not knowing his dad was at the house. I went to the school receptions and ask her if she had said I rang and told him to run home and she said she passed the message on I was very angry as my son was upset and told her they wouldn't let him go. My concern is that my son has said I should go quickly as my brother is in the house meaning he's on his own which is not true in just really scared they might phone social services\n",

I got passports for him I was told I don’t need his fathers permission as long as I take his full birth certificate with me which is fine... he comes the confusing part.. I was born in South Africa and left at about 6months old to live her so I have a South Africa birth certificate on my birth certificate my middle name is reeanna but I was always told my middle name was Rhiannon.. my father registered me [emoji15] so I had a passport as a child and my name was Rhiannon on that, my driving license is Rhiannon and on my sons birth certificate it’s Rhiannon!! So I applied for my first adult passport and I was told my middle name has to be the same as what’s on my birth certificate or I have to de poll my name so I just said no it’s fine I just wanted my passport.. anyway I’m in complete panic mode as if I get stop either going to Disney or out of Disney going by euro star and they ask me for my sons birth certificate and my middle names is not the same as on my passport will they stop us!!! I don’t know if I’m completely overthinking it or should I really be concerned [emoji46] thanks everyone in advance xxxx Sent from my iPhone using ::link_1::\n",

I see we will have to go for an interview yet he works for 35hrs a week I’m concerned they will question us about having a child that’s aged 9 together and now we have decided that we will live together.. or question me about him?

I thought the interview went great and at the end asked me for enhanced dbs which I agreed to so I was telling my mum and she said did you tell them about the time I went to court I said no... I actually completely forgot that I was did have to go to court about 10/11 years ago for assault I generally for I have been through so much since then and I’m a completely different place in my life and would never in life do this ever again anyway I know this will come up on my dbs but I didn’t tell them [emoji52] I’m now no I won’t get the job [emoji22] which I’m actually heartbroken over but I’m thinking maybe I should ring them and tell them I completely forgot or should I just forget about it any advice would be grateful xx Sent from my iPhone using ::link_1::\n",

Any way my youngest has special needs and autism im on benifits as a single mum and he lives with his parents. He comes over most nights after work to spend time with the children (I don’t let them go to his mums as she smokes and has a bad mould issues at her flat and a big dog which my son is petrified off) anyway he’s a big help to me and when my son doesn’t sleep he will come over and let me sleep and stay up with him.. he works 35+ hrs a week.. we spoke about moving in together recently and just see how it goes.. as far as I’m aware he has no bills at his mums just a credit card and his letters like bank statement but he’s not on the council tax.. anyway I’m wondering if we do move in who do I inform and will this make me go to universal credit any advice would be much appreciate Thank you Sent from my iPhone using ::link_1::\n",

      "My son and I recently wrote a book called, “That’s Cool!” (available on Amazon). One of our goals is to help kids with ADHD by directing their energies in learning life skills while raising their confidence, and building self-esteem. We believe that school-aged children will find the tricks in the book fun and give them a feeling of accomplishment. Joining your child in learning the tricks and skills in the book offers another opportunity to connect and develop an even closer relationship.\n",

      "Hi - I'm new here. I'll try not to ramble! About 18 months ago I read an article on Inattentive ADHD that fit my daughter so perfectly I could have cried. We're on the way to a diagnosis, which is being held up by lockdowns, Covid restrictions and school closures. We were referred to a New Forest Parenting Course, which was downgraded to a webinar due to Covid. It was useful, but obviously focused on how I could change my behaviour, rather than on coping strategies for my daughter. In addition, all the other parents seemed to have boys who had hyperactive/impulsivity problems - desperately in need of help, but very different. She's funny, bright, curious about the world, super-creative, thoughtful and enthusiastic about so many things, but she's losing track of her positives underneath the negatives. So much is a huge struggle for her. I'm trying, but I'm failing her massively - and the guilt of not spotting this earlier is really getting me down. Does anyone know of any groups, forums, Facebook groups etc where it's possible to find further help? I'm really struggling to find what she needs. Many thanks for reading, W\n",

      "Hey Jacqui, Hang in there, I bet you are doing a great job. I am in the same boat with my 9 years old who is in the process of getting diagnosed. And good for you getting this diagnosed at this time. I also subscribe to AHA parenting emails and have listened (more than once) to the audio book \"Calm parent Happy Child\" and these have helped immensely. Loads of information is on the AHAparenting website and its very easy to navigate too so if you don't have time to read the book it's all there (from what I can see) and its free too. I would join a good support group too (online or otherwise). This quote from Gorden B. Hincley helps me too and I've started reading it to him and my other children also: Believe in yourself. Believe in your capacity to do great and good things. Believe that no mountain is so high that you cannot climb it. Believe that no storm is so great that you cannot weather it. … You are a child of God, of infinite capacity.::link_1:: Stand a little taller, rise a little higher, be a little better. Make the extra effort. You will be happier. You will know a new satisfaction, a new gladness in your heart.::link_2:: Of course there will be some problems along the way. There will be difficulties to overcome. But they will not last forever. [God] will not forsake you. … Look to the positive. Know that He is watching over you, that He hears your prayers and will answer them, that He loves you and will make that love manifest.::link_3:: This quote is from here: (although it appears garbled) ::link_4:: We can do this! All the best, C (Katey is close to but not my real name :-)\n",

      "Hey guys,so basically im currently trying to get my son assessed for adhd and asd,ive got the dla forms here,i ordered them weeks ago. The school senco rang me and said that my sons teacher has said he's fine in school with no concerns. This really annoyed me as deep down i know theres something,ive had suspicions for 3 years and family/friends have mentioned it too. I just feel like the school are not really interested at all in trying to help. The only thing is on the dla forms theres a question that asks for a professional to fill it in. Obviously i know what my sons teacher is going to answer,so i was wondering has anyone sent the form off before without filling in the professional bit? Or did you get someone else to fill it in other than the teacher x\n",

      "Hey! Good evening! I have known my step daughter since she was 2 years old (Now 11) and I really feel that she presents many traits of a child with ASD. Since being little everyone has always commented on how quiet/shy she is and honestly I never really thought anything more of it until the last few years. She started high school in September 20 and since then it seems to have become really obvious and I feel like I've let her down in not noticing the signs sooner. She hasn't made any new friends since starting high school, not a single one. She has always struggled to make friends and the friends she has made she has always struggled to keep. Its like its a chore for her to have friends. We go on holiday every year (besides 2020 obvs) and she's never once made friends with any of the other children in the pool etc and just sits entirely by herself reading. She's obsessive with reading and gets through a few book a week, im talking books that would take me a few weeks to get through she reads in a day or two. She also struggles massively with social cues. For example, saying hello and goodbye to people even when they say it first. She has never once said happy birthday to anyone, including her Dad and her siblings, or merry Christmas etc. Its like she genuinely doesn't get those cues. She's exactly the same with saying sorry, unless she's told to apologise for something it wouldn't even cross her mind. Alongside this she very rarely smiles, even when I'm sure inside shes excited or enjoying something, she shows no emotion at all. She never smiles back at people and very, very rarely initiates a conversation. If anyone starts a conversation with her she rarely answers verbally, she will just shrug her shoulders or nod her head instead. On the rare occasion she does respond verbally, its yes or no and very rarely anything more. She is more than capable at responding verbally, her speech was absolutely amazing from when I met her a two years old, she just chooses not to. The next thing I've noticed and has been an issue for many years is clothing and shoes. Getting her into a bridesmaid dress for our wedding was her worst nightmare. She lives in joggers and a hoody with no seams, hates socks and how they feel and will only wear trainers that are 2 sizes too big as her size 'feel tight'. Also getting her to wear sunscreen in the summer is an absolute nightmare!! she goes into a horrendously bad mood all day because I make her put it on to keep her safe in the sun but she can't stand the feel of it on her skin. She has never been an affectionate child, hugging her is, and has always been like hugging an ironing board. She goes completely stiff and moves away as quick as she can. I'm not really sure why I'm posting on here, I think its to get a feel for is it just me that thinks this? I've spoken to my husband about it and he agrees, but I feel like he just buries his head in the sand with it and hasn't got the energy in him anymore to fight her corner. His ex (stepdaughters mum) is, well, a nightmare basically. We have had to fight through the courts for many years to ensure we saw my stepdaughter as her mum stopped all contact for no reason when they split. I feel like I can't go to her to discuss my concerns as i know she wouldn't even entertain it. She absolutely hates me (for no reason other than because I was the new gf many years ago) and although my husband and I have been together for 9 years and have 2 other children, she acts like me and my daughters don't exist. Obviously with school now all online and only remote access, I don't know where to start in getting her assessed? She hides most of the traits quite well, and mainly appears as quiet and extremely introvert but as she's gotten older it's definitely becoming more apparent, im just not sure if school would be able to pick up on all of her traits without assessing her social interaction around school? Has anyone else been in this position that could possibly point me in the right direction? Its starting to cause a few issues at home as my 7 year-old can't understand why her sister treats her the way she does. Some days she will play in her room with her, lining up all of her lol dolls and making sure they have the correct outfits on etc and then the following day completely ignores her and won't speak a word. Thanks x\n",

      "Hi, I'm just after a bit of help/advice really. My son got referred to iscan for a possible attention deficit back in March (literally a few weeks before covid kicked off big time in the UK and I had my second baby). He has speech delay and before this referral he went to get his hearing checked just to rule out if that was anything to do with his delayed speech. His hearing was fine but the woman who was testing his hearing mentioned that maybe it was autism and that's why the health visitor came to see us. He definately has poor attention, I've always known this and because of this his learning is behind and he's not where other children his age are at. He's since started nursery school who have been amazing and have put different things in place to help him and I've signed an IDP. The teacher has also mentioned autism before (he went through a very short phase of tipping everything on its side). We've learnt that he won't be seen by ISCAN untill maybe April 2021 due to a backlog in cases because of coronavirus. I don't really know what I want out of this thread sorry 🙈 Does he sound similar to anyone else's child? I want to know what he has so that I know how to help, so that I would know what strategies to work and have a better understanding of how his brain works and why he's does the things he does. Does anyone know if going private is an option? He needs funding for a one to one in school. He also doesn't play a lot anymore. He just runs back and forth making noises. Has anyone got any ideas of what could keep his attention? Are there any toys you find your children like if they have attention issues? We have major issues at bedtime. Sometimes he can takes hours and then even more hours to get him to sleep. He always wakes once or twice in the night. My partner normally then goes in with him and just stays with him while I have the baby. He normally goes straight back to sleep. The other night however, he woke at 3 and would not go back to sleep untill half 5,he was wide awake!! This happens every now and again. Again, any tips welcome? Just any advice, help, any reply would help really! Thanks for listening!\n",

      "Hi Laura, I'm sorry to hear of your struggles. My daughter is 7 years old and we got a private diagnosis for autism is October. It cost £1700 so not cheap. We are now trying to get her assessed for ADHD. If I'm honest, from what you are saying about your son it sounds to me like ADHD. My daughter is hyper and struggles to get to sleep but we found phennagen tablets help. We usually crush one up in her juice so she isn't even aware as she has gagged when taking them and that put her off. The night time ones are not suitable for children and we had to say that the daytime ones that we giver her were for us to help us sleep. She doesn't have one every night, just every now and then. Sorry I can't be more help, but feel free to message if you want someone to chat too. There really is no support out there and its such a day to day struggle. Sarah xxx\n",

      "Hi everyone .. I have a newly diagnosed child with ADHD .. 3 children all together. As some of you may no bedtimes are a nightmare, my oldest keeps the younger ones awake for hours or if they fall asleep the oldest wakes them up with noise ect .. he/she even keeps me up all hours & will try anything to agitate the whole house .. keep coming down the stairs, flicking light switch on and off to the point I've had to remove the bulb ... Suddenly he/she decides to brush teeth at whatever time of night .. anyway I'm currently on the waiting list for a 3bed .. has anyone got a letter from a doctor to take to your housing group to say how much of an issue having an ADHD child in the same room as the other siblings is and has anyone been moved up a band or moved forward on the list ... Sorry if this post is long but it's the hardest thing to try and get the children settles at night and think it would improve greatly if ADHD child had own room ... Thankyou\n",

      "I’m a 54 year old grandmother who looks after my grandson with adhd and autism! His mother ( my daughter) died & years ago and I’ve brought him up since! I’ve fought and fought for years for his diagnoses and been to umpteen school meetings where he’s been excluded continuously that I homeschooled him for a year! I then got him in another school that accepted you when you turned 14 and he was removed after three weeks for hitting a teacher! He then got put in a pupil referral school and was continuously excluded! He’s now in college and fingers crossed doing ok! My remaining children hate him ! My daughter 25 and son 23 who has just moved out three weeks ago due to his behaviour! Last Wednesday I came in from shopping and he attacked me! It’s not the first time it’s happened! He attacked me because he attempted to attack my daughter after she told him to do something (trivial) I got in the way of them and he beat me up! I’m bruised all up my arms and back! Thus gas now happened a handful of times! I’m his full time carer and all I want to do is give him up! He’s nearly 17. I don’t work so rely on being his carer! I think bad thoughts all the time to escape him and spend a lot of time locked away in my room if he’s in the house and not at college and I’m alone with him! I hate him!

      "Hi sorry saw you didn't have a reply so couldn't not reply. How old is he? If he attends school or nursery speak to them and they can refer him for an assessment. Once the assessment is carried out they will discuss in further detail. For now I would say try and note his triggers, if he gets angry give him a pillow to hit & time away from others to cool down and when he's ready he can come back to you without making a thing out of it. I have found children with adhd also struggle with expressing how they actually feel, it can be gently extracted sometimes but you have to catch it before the anger begins. Also once you find something they are interested in this can be used for a variety of activities to help their attention span. For example if he likes dinosaurs, create 'trees' out of toilet rolls or paint some for them to walk through a forest, do some messy play some mushed weetabix for 'dinosaur food', blue cornflour for a river ect.... When practising counting use dinosaurs to count ect... But this all obviously varies upon his age but just some ideas. This is just from some experience as a ta but every child is different, persevere - you've got this!\n",

      "Hi My name is Angie and my son was about 18 months old when I realised he was different! He’s the youngest of 4. He’s now 11 and just two days ago started medication for ADHD. I fought for years to get some help but it was something that no one would really commit to. Then in year 4 I just went up to his teacher and asked her what she thought? She agreed there n then she thought he had adhd! It hit me like a brick wall, at last, someone believes! Cut a long story short, he’s now in yr 7 and a few months ago said to me he wanted meds so he could do better at school like the other kids. So that’s what we did! ( his dad doesn’t agree) I’m worried what affect the meds will have on him but I have to try this. It’s such a hard thing to deal with, you can see the way people look at your child, you hear the way they are treated by some disbelievers and it messes you up! Go with your gut! It’s your baby you have to protect and help them the best you can. 😘\n"

I had an idea of running a 'rent-2-play' (toy library-ish) business from home. Especially as I have a fair amount of toys around the place already! Would this sort of thing appeal to people, would a web list of toys & prices help. Would a waiting list for 'high demand' toys be a good idea? Please, any advice or feedback welcome!!\n",

I don't know if our DD was down to luck or the calendar month,but if you & your OH try 1 more time, you have got to make sure that your in the right state of mind to deal with things, incase the baby is another boy.

      "hi Cherie. I have 3 children. I breast fed my 2nd fully for 3mths (but had to continue with night feeds til 6mths.) I have an 8mth old, who I've only just managed in the past 2wks, get to her to take bottles during the day. 2nd had 1day of what felt like constant short feeds every 1-2hrs, but then the next day had longer feeds & longer 'catch up' sleeps. my 8mth old, feed every 2hrs. Every other, or every 2nd day, she has 'catch up' sleeps too. If your baby falls asleep after a short feed, rub his/her foot, or palm of hand, to encourage them to feed for longer. It takes approx 20-30mins to fully empty 1 breast. This will help your body to produce enough milk for your baby. Don't forget, your baby may want to feed more, if he/she is having a growth spurt! It may help to keep a note of times & how long the feeds last. That way you will be able to see what feed pattern you have, & try to gradually move the times to suit. Good luck with everything!!:D\n",

The school said they will resubmit app, once the ATA report comes through (which should be soon.)Can they just resubmitt, or do they have to go thru appeal process. Also, how many times can you submitt a req, & can we as parents request 1 alongside the schools req, in order to show desperation. Myself & MH are concerned with his learning progress (v.poor- motor skills, concerntration, S&L, reading etc) we have discussed whether a SEN school would be better for him, as we have heard stories of others making great personal & academic progress . Should the next req of statment asst be refused, & the learning gap become bigger between him & peers. Is there any other way we may be able to consider a SEN school.

I did an access course in 2003/04, when my baby was 7mts.I had a uni interview in 2004, which due to circumstances, I had to cancel. I have since had another 2 children - youngest 18mths. This week I have been looking into doing distance learning courses in extra G.C.S.E's and A levels. That way,I will have the entry requirements to start the degree, as soon as the times right to apply. The other benefit, is that GCSE's are a life long qualification, so I won't be wasting any more time or money on courses that have a shelf life. I thought while I'm a SAHM, and will be few a while yet. I could do part time study around the kids. If you time the enrolling well, you can have over a year to study, before you sit the exams. Or if you need to get an earlier qualification, they can sometimes arrange a speed through course. I haven't given up on my dream of midwifery training, I still believe one day I'll get there!!:)\n",

      "Hi everyone, I'm after your advise pls. Last month, after 2-3yrs of fighting the LEA, I won a statement of SEN for my son. His school had previously applied on 2 occasions, but the statutory assessment was refused. Which is why I then tried applying. My son is 7yrs 9mths. He was diagnosed with Atypical Autisim in Nov 2008. He currently attends a mainstream school, but has remained back a year,(stayed in yr2, but should be yr3.) as he cannot access the curriculum. He is still working at 'P' Levels (18mths-2yrs behind peer group.) All the professionals SaLT, EP, Autism Advisory, sch SENco, child development Dr (who carried out Medical examination for the assessment,) plus few others. Have stated the following in their reports. he has significant delays, needs lots of adult support, highly likely to not be accessing the national curriculum, is very distracted, cannot retain information, does not have strong peer relationships.... to name a few. Not to mention his sensory issues, anxiety issues etc.. As parents we want the best for our child. Between home & school, over the past 2-3yrs, we have persevered with all the tasks & stratagies outside professionals have implemented. All of which have failed to help my son access the cirriculum, & progress academically. So we decided a special needs schools with specialist provision would be better suited for him. (his current school agreed, they have no extra funding for him. He is allocated 1hr per day 1-1 which just is not enough!) Our request for specialist provision went before 'The Panel' on Friday. I found out yesterday that they have REFUSED mld provisions for him, & say that his school needs more help. WE ARE TOTALLY DEVASTATED WITH THEIR DECISION!!! They will send an outreach package to them, for them to put in place. How are they supposed to do this when they have NO FUNDING??! The SENco & teachers at the school are as shocked at the outcome as we are, and we are all confused as to how much more delayed a child needs to be in mainstream school, before these people stand up and listen. They keep saying/stating 'Every child matters.' why do my childs needs not seem to matter?!!!! Sorry for ranting, but needed to sound off. Thank you for taking the time to read & comment. xx\n",

Thats another reason why our SENco questioned why they are sending out packages from outreach. Beacause they don'y have the funds or resources to put them im place.\n",

      "Hi Andrew As far as myself and the school are concerned. We have exhausted all avenues. Both times in the past when the statutory assessment was refused. We had to wait a min period of 6 months to provide evidence the stratagies were not working. We have proven all of these many times over. Having regular outside professionals assess his progress with SaLT, IEP targets, Ed Pshyc, etc..all of these have to provide reports after each observation/meeting with him/us. He has been on school action plus since reception class. He should technically be in yr3 now, but as I said he has been kept back a year. His assessment with SaLT & Ed Pshyc all showed little progress since age 5yrs 10mths. In fact, because he's now being assessed at a higher age group, these results show significant delays in most areas. And a decrease on his percentile due to the lack of progress. I am due the final statement at the end of this week, but will check the hours quoted on the provisional one (not to hand at present, got 2 poorly girls to look after at the mo also.) Yes it is a T/A that does the 1-1, I do not know what level she is at. (Does that make a difference?) With regards to the number of children. His school was originally a nursery & infant's only. I think the SENco mentioned to me there were around 35 in the school at that time which she showed me a large lever arch file for their paperwork. My son had a bigger file, & then some just to himself. This Sept, his school amalgamated with the junior school next door. During the transition induction day visit, the teacher whos class he would have been in, said she had to sit with him to try & help him with the given task. He can not work independently, & she said the jump to KS2 is big, & they would have no one to support him. Now our SENco will be covering the whole 'New' school, but I do not know overall how many SEN children there are. Total number of pupils, approx breakdown 2 nursery classes 2 reception classes (45 intake) 1 year1 class 2 year2 classes I assume (as they are in a separate building next door) 1 class each of yr3-yr6 I'm sorry I can't be more specific re the school figures.

His attainment levels are in LA guidance for a mainstream school. He is 7yr 9mths, technically a yr3, kept back in yr2, working on P Levels. How can that be?

While packing up my house to move, I had an idea, that I would appreciate some feedback on pls, before I get to involved with plans that maybe no good! We seem to have -like many other people, accumilated stacks of toys- even after regular clear outs. I wondered if I set up a good quality used toy hire/rental business, with maybe an option to buy, would this be of interest to anyone. Would like to hear from parents/carers, as well as toddler groups & early years settings leaders. As we know toys are not always cheap, & children quickly outgrow or 'go off' toys. I thought this would keep toys 'fresh & exciting' to children regularly. As well as helping parents/carers, group leaders from spending over the odds on items (monies tight in current climate) and easing storage problems. Thank you for reading, & taking the time to comment. :nmswave:\n",

      "Hi ladies. I'm happy for you both, I know exactly how hard it is. My son has ASD was diagnosed Nov 2008 (after having 2 other children, & he was fine with both. looked forward to meeting them.) I managed to get the assesment & statement last year, after applying by parent application. The school applied twice over a period of 12-18mths & were refused both times, which is why we stepped in and applied instead. Each step u win is such a huge acheivement, & very exciting. But u then realise that u then have the next step to fight and so on... We applied for specialist provision as making very little/no progress in mainstream. We were turnrd down by the panel. Not happy to take the decision we fought on. Re-appealed to the panel, refused again. Deflated & heartbroken foe a 2nd time, we carried on for OS sake. We were all he had to fight his corner. 3rd time infront of panel, the agreed a split placement between MLD & mainstream. This week he has just started his new placement (I bawled my eyes out) We are finally managing to get the education & support he needs & deserves. I have concerns bout how the return to mainstream will affect him so shall monitor closely. Good luck ladies, don't give up ur kids need u, the schools can only do so much, so u may eventually have to step in like we did. It's not easy, it's been a long hard, emotional, & stressful battle. Even with him starting MLD, I cannot sit back, I personally feel I need to monitor progess & emotions, behaviour etc as the mixed routines of 2 schools could affect him alot. I hope u all get wot u want & ur child needs. xx :nmswave:\n",

As I am currently buying specialist logo nursery uniform for my youngest, I realised even when able to mix with high street uniform (greys, polo T-Shirts etc..) it has still worked out quite expensive.

      "Hi everyone. I'm after some advice/experience stories if possible, as dnt know anyone who's had this dilemma. I have 3 children (9yrs, 5yrs & 3yrs) & expecting a 4th in early June. My DS who is the eldest is autistic (diagnosed at 5yrs 10mths.) he attends an MLD school. MyDD of 5yrs, doesn't seem to have any academic issues, but does have some behavioural/temper issues. - she has in the past had CDC assessment & review (was discharged) due to our concern, her brothers history of assessments, & her at-the-time Speech & Language delayed development (which she has now also been discharged from due to progress.) Now she's in year1, her behaviour flare ups are becoming more noticeable, & the school are bringing the Ed Pysc in to assess her, I myself am considering contacting the CDC Dr again with regards to considering referral to a CDAC. Now you have some background info, what I want to ask is: My son gets very anxious about unknown/unplanned things. He knows a baby will come out of mummy's tummy near the summer. He's getting worried & crying now about the pain I'll be in, & about me going into hospital. This will now continue until the baby arrives. My husband and I don't know whether it's worth asking for a c-section, so we can prepare our son especially, for exactly when the baby will be born. (he was diagnosed after the other 2 were born, so we were none-the -wiser about his issues then.) And he won't see me in pain with first stages of labour. We know it's classed as a major op. my hospital stay will be a bit longer & the recovery longer, but we can plan & Prepare the children better with what will happen, especially as a lot going on with DD assessments now starting up again. I have mentioned this to my midwife, she gave me an NHS info website to look at & read about all the pros & cons of c-sections. And said If we still want to go ahead & speak to someone I can do at my 28wk appt (mid March.) We feel a bit stuck between a rock & a hard place at the mo, as can't make a definite decision & dnt know anyone who's had this dilemma before!!

What started off as a tummy ache, turned into emergency abdominal surgery on NYE 2006. Blue light ambulance transfer to Addenbrookes, after 2days in QEII with no one knowing what was wrong. He was in Addenbrookes for bout 10days on HDU. nil by mouth for 9 of them, & tubes & monitors everywhere. Has a scar from side to side on his abdomin. His sister also had tonsil & adenoid op Dec 2010. What was meant to be a day case, turned into a 3night stay. At 6wk post op, the consultant noticed a piece of tonsil had NOT been removed. Was not visible without depressing her tongue with spatula. It was discoloured and answered the questions, why she wasn't eating properly & kept coughing saying something was stuck in her throat. She was re-admitted as a day case in March 2011. It's all drama with us, nothing straight forward......but we continue to smile!!\n",

I'm trying to look at the bigger picture incl time, best results, cost, If entry requirements change over the years, I want the overall better option. I wouldn't do the Access until nearer the year I am ready to apply to Uni. As I have heard they have 'a shelf life.' And they are preferred to be a recent form of study ( within approx 3years?)

      "The NHS bursaries are no longer available. Department of Health Policy paper NHS bursary reform Updated 27 January 2017 Contents Deferment from previous years Transitional arrangements Repaying student loans Additional funding Why changes to funding have been made From 1 August 2017, new nursing, midwifery and most allied health students will no longer receive NHS bursaries. Instead, they will have access to the same student loans system as other students. This applies to new students on pre-registration courses (those which lead to registration with one of the health professional regulators). Students who already have a degree and are planning to undertake a nursing, midwifery or allied health profession subject as a second degree will now also have access to student loans through the student loans system. Courses affected: Nursing (adult, child, mental health, learning and disability) Midwifery Dietetics Occupational therapy Orthoptics Orthotics and prosthetics Physiotherapy Podiatry/chiropody Radiography (diagnostic and therapeutic) Speech and language therapy Operating department practitioner This change applies only to new students. New students are defined as starting a course: for the first time on 1 August 2017 or later on 1 August 2017 or later, having withdrawn from or abandoned a previous higher education course in the 2016/17 academic year or an earlier academic year on 1 August 2017 or later, as a full time student, having transferred from a previous part-time course or full-time distance learning course which started before 1 August 2017 Deferment from previous years Students who applied for a place on a course that started in 2016/17 but deferred to September 2017, will be affected by the new arrangements. Students who started courses in 2016/17 and then had to defer for significant reasons, for example, maternity leave or illness, will continue under the current bursary system. It will be for the NHS Business Services Authority in agreement with the Department of Health and Health Education England to determine appropriateness for deferment. Transitional arrangements We carried out a consultation on how to successfully implement these changes. As set out in the consultation response, transitional arrangements have been established for particular programmes. Applications for the bursary element for postgraduate, dental hygiene and dental therapy courses as well as part-time students will need to be made through the NHS Business Services Authority Postgraduate courses leading to registration and dental hygiene/dental therapy students The government will continue to provide a bursary for tuition and maintenance to meet the full costs of the course for a capped number of new students starting in 2017/18. Part-time students The government will continue to provide a maintenance bursary for part-time courses for the duration of the course for a capped number of new students starting in 2017/18. Part-time students will have access to tuition fee loans through the standard student finance route. Students who change from part-time to full time courses during their study will no longer be eligible to receive the NHS maintenance bursary from the date of the changes. Students will then need to apply to the Student Loans Company to receive support for living costs. Academic year 2018/19 The government in due course will set out arrangements for dental hygiene, dental therapy and postgraduate courses leading to registration that start in 2018/19. Subject to a wider consultation on part-time undergraduate maintenance loans, the plan is for new nursing, midwifery and allied health students beginning part time courses from 2018/19 onwards to apply for both tuition and maintenance loans through the Student Loans Company. Repaying student loans Repayment terms are the same as for other students who have taken out a student loan at university. Graduates become eligible to pay back their loans in the April after they graduate, and then they will have to pay back only 9% of their earnings over £21,000 a year. Any outstanding loans are written off after 30 years. For example, a newly qualified nurse or allied health professional earning £21,700 would pay back £5.25 per month. Read more about repaying a student loan on GOV.UK. The Student Loans Company also has further information on loan repayments and the Funding Clinic has lots of information about student finance. Additional funding The NHS Business Services Authority will provide additional funding for some nursing, midwifery and allied health professional students because of the compulsory clinical placement required by these courses. Eligible students may be able to access the following: a non-repayable grant of £1,000 per year if they have child dependants exceptional support of up to £3,000 per year in the case of severe hardship support for excess travel and dual accommodation expenses incurred by attending practice placements The NHS Business Services Authority website will provide further details about when funding applications can be made well in advance of the start of the 2017/18 academic year. Students with child dependants Students who meet the eligibility criteria and have eligible child dependants can apply for the Child Dependants Allowance of £1,000 per year for each year of study (pro rata if studying less than full-time). The payment is not related to the number of dependants. The annual payment is to ensure students are able to continue to study and attend practice placements. The payment is not related to students incurring costs due to childcare arrangements. Severe hardship There will be an Exceptional Support Fund of up to £3,000 available for eligible students facing severe hardship. The NHS Business Services Authority will be administering this scheme and further details will be available shortly. This is in addition to sources of exceptional hardship funding support which students may be eligible for at their university of study. Travel and accommodation costs Students who are on an eligible programme will be entitled to claim travel and accommodation expenses incurred over and above daily travel costs to university. The costs must be related to essential practice placements. Those with dual accommodation can claim £55 per night for commercial accommodation, such as a hotel or bed and breakfast, and £25 per night for non-commercial accommodation, such as staying with friends or family. Why changes to funding have been made The funding reforms will help to secure the healthcare workforce, by: enabling universities to offer up to 10,000 extra training places on pre-registration healthcare programmes offering students around 25% more upfront financial support while studying - for example, a single student on a 3-year programme would receive approximately £2,000 more each year on a student loan compared to an NHS bursary improving access to pre-registration undergraduate study for those from disadvantaged backgrounds giving students with an existing qualification the chance to get funding for a second degree Find out more about careers in health I've waited 15yrs to train, & need to wait a few more. 😫 But I always read what I can to find out any changes..... I hope this helps you, Good Luck! ☘️\n",

      "Hi everyone. I would like to customise some of my daughters clothes, with hotfix crystals. I have not used these before (only non hot fix) and wondered if anyone knew any cheap places in UK, (I can only find USA) that would cut my own design templates on sticky flock. This seem to be the easiest, quickest and a re-usable option.... I haven’t got the funds to buy my own vinyl plotter cutter and heat press. Hence looking where to have designs cut and also buy Pre-cut design e.g letters and numbers. And use my own iron 😂 .... cheap & cheerful! Thank you 😊\n",

      "Hi. I want to have some laser hair removal treatment. I have found 2 places local to me, and have friends that have used both. Their prices vary by £10-£20, but one uses Cadela GentleMax laser. The other uses Lynton Luminette Advanced IPL. Does anyone have any advice or recommendations on either of these please? Obviously laser treatment is not cheap, so I want to find out as much as possible before going ahead with it. Thanks\n",

      "Thanks for the info ladies. I’ve read the candela is the better one (from America) but that is the most expensive one. Due to family commitments, I’ve just had to give up my little job, so thinking I should go for the cheaper Lynton Luminette IPL option. But I don’t want to be disappointed with the results & wish I’d gone for the more expensive one. I like the idea of Elma cream. I wonder if I could use that under their treatment? 🤔 If anyone else has any advice, please comment. Thanks x\n",

After researching temperament, size, characteristics etc.. we have narrowed it down to either a Cavachon or Cocker Spaniel (edging more to the working breed, than show.) Does anyone have any experience of either breed, what are the good & bad qualities in both? I have 4 children age ranging 6-16. 2 have autism. TIA 😊🐶\n"
